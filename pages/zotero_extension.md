title: zotero extension
---

## optimally, what i'd like is a generic way to reference texts that exist outside of this system;
### urls alone don't cut it
## the easiest thing to do is to is take this
### https://github.com/argenos/zotero-mdnotes
### reformat it so that each citation is a note, in your citation format
### so you can go like [[big chungus, 2017]]
## prior art:
### https://github.com/hannesfrank/remnote-zotero-import
### https://github.com/melat0nin/zotero-roam-export
## add to https://github.com/logseq/awesome-logseq later
## this is the proper way to do it:
### https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/client_coding/http_integration_protocol
### https://github.com/zotero/zotero-google-docs-integration/blob/master/src/apps-script/Code.js
