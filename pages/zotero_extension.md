title: zotero extension
---

## optimally, what i'd like is a generic way to reference texts that exist outside of this system;
### urls alone don't cut it
## the easiest thing to do is to is take this
### https://github.com/argenos/zotero-mdnotes
### reformat it so that each citation is a note, in your citation format
### so you can go like [[big chungus, 2017]]
## TODO each file should have a little header, with a link to the entry in the individual's zotero collection
