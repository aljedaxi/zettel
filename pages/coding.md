> One of von Neumann's students at Princeton recalled that graduate students were being used to hand assemble programs into binary for their early machine. This student took time out to build an assembler, but when von Neumann found out about it he was very angry, saying that it was a waste of a valuable scientific computing instrument to use it to do clerical work.

## i do not write code; i *code*
#### simultaneous hyperfetishization of writing with disparagement of the humanities
##### i would like to kill the concept of the code-base, 
to limit talk away from code and towards: _____
###### don't repeat *yourself*
##### the codebase should be a [[picture]] of the problem space
###### code is a [[representation]] of your understanding of the problem
code that you refactor is code that represents an old understanding
the act of refactoring is recognizing this staleness
#### "one thing i'm going to talk a lot about it fetishism, which is a kinda ugly form of abstraction"
