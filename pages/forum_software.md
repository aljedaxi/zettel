- checkout [[remnote]], the way they handle rems (might better model posts)
  - remnote.io/invite/Z6345onTmZfRL7tc9
- https://anagora.org/node/index
- the idea is to allow for collective [[sensemaking]]
- https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/ <- this is where Vannevar Bush detailed the Memex
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ3gmh-d9oI <- Xanadu
- how do we handle data ownership? i would like to think of the forum as the place where posts, each which stands on their own, are jammed together and [word for that thing that happens when disparate things are compared]
  - but this understanding doesn't reflect the process of collective thinking through conversation
  - long form and shortform content; collective thinking and collected thought
- we can think of each comment as having the form "thesis, justification"; thence we can reference comments by "thesis, author";
