title: user interface
---

## the goal of a user interface is to empower the user

### i can remember when i made my first real programming project; when i integrating a web server (at the very end of the process), and rapidly built up representations of the backend i'd spent so long building, i experienced the most sublime feeling of power.
we should create opportunities for that with all our interfaces.
## from [this thread](https://mastodon.social/@zensaiyuki/102683452946911475)
- prefer undo to confirmation boxes
- Gall’s Law:
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.
- if you want to teach the user about a feature, include easy to find examples.
- don’t interrupt flow of thought. if a user is opening an application, they usually have some specific task to complete. nagging them at this point in time about software updates or handy tips is very user hostile.
- the “save” icon looking like a floppy disk. it’s very appropriate, since the command as a concept is built around the technological limits of floppy disks, limits that are comically irrelevant in the 21st century.drag your app out of the 1980s and implement autosave and version control already.
- try to imagine ways to use your shiny new software to abuse, harass, stalk, or spy on people, especially vulnerable people. ask a diverse range of people to do the same. 
- UX is ergonomics of the mind (and also body).
- user interfaces typically “map” to the system they control, each button and dial corresponding to some element of the system. Natural mapping is when the interface forms an obvious spatial relationship to the system, such as 4 stovetop dials that are in the same arrangement as the stovetops.

## UI metrics 
- Fitt's, Hick's, GOMS
- 0.1 seconds means the thing is reacting instantaneously; 1.1 means the user's thought is interrupted; 10+ seconds means the user is going to want to do something else. [source](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/)
