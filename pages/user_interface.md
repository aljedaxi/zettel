## the goal of a user interface is to empower the user

### i can remember when i made my first real programming project; when i integrating a web server (at the very end of the process), and rapidly built up representations of the backend i'd spent so long building, i experienced the most sublime feeling of power.
we should create opportunities for that with all our interfaces.
