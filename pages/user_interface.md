## the goal of a user interface is to empower the user

### i can remember when i made my first real programming project; when i integrating a web server (at the very end of the process), and rapidly built up representations of the backend i'd spent so long building, i experienced the most sublime feeling of power.
we should create opportunities for that with all our interfaces.

- prefer undo to confirmation boxes
- Gall’s Law:
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.
- if you want to teach the user about a feature, include easy to find examples.
- don’t interrupt flow of thought. if a user is opening an application, they usually have some specific task to complete. nagging them at this point in time about software updates or handy tips is very user hostile.
- the “save” icon looking like a floppy disk. it’s very appropriate, since the command as a concept is built around the technological limits of floppy disks, limits that are comically irrelevant in the 21st century.drag your app out of the 1980s and implement autosave and version control already.
