## outline

##### to focus on one thing, it has to be one thing
### finally, i would like to ask "what it is to be a poet"
#### the man who was thursday
#### to live something
#### "and living means making a choice", between monday and thursday---for/in that moment.

### me and my friend have the same problem: the arches of our feet de-arch-ify. we've both found the same solution: walking digitigrade. and i know for me, i've gained a strange appreciation for a distinguished feminine elegance; perhaps not because of it, but certainly not in spite of it.
#### what does this if else tell us? it tells us that the caller may tell me different things, and i know what to do with that. does it tell me i know better what to do than they do? sometimes.

## "a loop is a way of doing one thing over and over again. if it is infact one thing, you should be able to express it as a quantum of computation: a function."

### an exploration of what language is
#### dancing is a language that is felt instead of heard
#### what is it to "speak" a language; to "communicate" in that language?

### an exploration of what is poetical, relative to language
### an exploration of the form of `the line`
#### we measure the complexity, our changes, in terms of lines,
and again, in terms of code
#### [[DRY code]] , [[coding]]
### an exploration of how we can apply that to the act of programming
#### what is the act of programming?

### The question of being for programmers
> there have been a lot of talks with roughly the same thesis over the years: the possibility space of programming is shrinking, honing in on an ever more specific set of modalities
> wherefore? because we have forgotten the question of programming. thereby i'd like to present the following: a following of the questioning of being, one of the grandest reimaginings in the history of philosophy

  - what does this sound like? whose attitudes does this recapitulate?
  - whence come these attitudes.
