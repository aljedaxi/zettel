## outline

#### simultaneous hyperfetishization of writing with disparagement of the humanities
##### i would like to kill the concept of the code-base, 
to limit talk away from code and towards: _____
##### the codebase should be a [[picture]] of the problem space
###### code is a [[representation]] of your understanding of the problem
code that you refactor is code that represents an old understanding
the act of refactoring is recognizing this staleness
#### "one thing i'm going to talk a lot about it fetishism, which is a kinda ugly form of abstraction"
### finally, i would like to ask "what it is to be a poet"
#### the man who was thursday
#### to live something
#### "and living means making a choice", between monday and thursday---for/in that moment.
