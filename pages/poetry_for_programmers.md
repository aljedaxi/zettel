title: poetry for programmers
---

## outline
### ... thereby we shall construct a series of numbered propositions—in the style of 20th centurys most esteemed mystical poet, Ludwig Wittgenstein— to act as a table of contents, and a scaffolding 4 further conversation.
### read Cummings
### the poetry of the tractatus
#### the poetry of math and logic
#### the poetry of [[thought]]
##### thereby, the aesthesis, organization
#### [[intellectual rigor]]?
#### THE JOINTS THE JOINTS THE JOINTS
### and ultimately all forms of communication
### the way we define programming defines the way we program
#### https://lizkeogh.com/2013/06/17/theres-no-such-thing-as-declarative-and-imperative/
#### to name is magick
#### the ability to focus is a function of working memory management
##### to be meaningful is to be memorable
##### to focus on one thing, it has to be one thing
### i do not write code; i *code*
#### simultaneous hyperfetishization of writing with disparagement of the humanities
##### i would like to kill the concept of the code-base, 
to limit talk away from code and towards: _____
#### "one thing i'm going to talk a lot about it fetishism, which is a kinda ugly form of abstraction"
### finally, i would like to ask "what it is to be a poet"
#### the man who was thursday
#### to live something
#### "and living means making a choice", between monday and thursday---for/in that moment.

## to make sense of code; [[sensemaking]]
### me and my friend have the same problem: the arches of our feet de-arch-ify. we've both found the same solution: walking digitigrade. and i know for me, i've gained a strange appreciation for a distinguished feminine elegance; perhaps not because of it, but certainly not in spite of it.
