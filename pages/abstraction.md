title: abstraction
---

## abstraction is taking a property of something, and giving it legs.
there are five apples. there is no "five" in the world: these are only apples.
we take the "five" from the apples and give it its own existence. that's why number—and colour and structure and size—are abstract principles. they come about through abstraction.

the first philosopher thought everything was water. the first really memorable philosopher thought everything was fire. well, everything is in flux, but flux isn't a thing. fire is the thing of flux: a symbol of an abstraction. 

the first man to call himself a philosopher thought everything was number. at this point, it should strike us that the philosophical impetuous is the impetuous towards abstraction. it should strike us that the far east never had philosophy or religion, because philosophy abstracts things and religion things abstracts.
## there is abstraction *to*, abstraction *through*, and abstraction *from*
### we abstract to triangle, from uhhhh um AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
### all art is necessarily an abstraction from aestheses; pictures of aesthetics?
