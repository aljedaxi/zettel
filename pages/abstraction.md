## abstraction is taking a property of something, and giving it legs.
there are five apples. there is no "five" in the world: these are only apples.
## there is abstraction *to*, abstraction *through*, and abstraction *from*
### we abstract to triangle, from uhhhh um AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
### all art is necessarily an abstraction from aestheses; pictures of aesthetics?
## *to abstract* is to reify a property
