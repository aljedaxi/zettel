### # A bit of philosophy for Sabi 
The poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht, a committed Marxist, had anticipated this bleak assessment of culture. His notion of ‘epic theatre’ sought to reverse the ideological grip of traditional, ‘culinary theatre’, which Brecht despised for the way it fostered empathetic identification with dramatic characters. In response, Brecht developed what he called a Verfremdungseffekt or ‘estrangement effect’ to disrupt precisely this pattern (the German Verfremdung was a variant of Entfremdung, the term normally translated as alienation). Actors refused to conceal the fact that they were acting, and they frequently breached the fourth wall separating the stage from the audience in order to foreground the artifice of the production.

Sabi meets Daxi in a theater, before a play. Daxi's at the bar.
    “you come here often?” ; it's Sabi, but without her «quotation marks». Say something about how i spoil my readers with my quotation marks.
    The play begins. This one was written by Sabi. The curtains draw back, and there's Sabi on stage. At a bar. Daxi walks on, and asks “you come here often?”
    Sabi tiene to daxi and says «i fucking hate it here. I don't know why I'm here. It's out of character for me to be here.»
    „but you're here. Something about this place must agree with you, or you wouldn't be here.“
    Themes:
    Knowledge is virtue
    Human character : is a human character? The resulting of the human to the character, as outlined in the above article.
    Desire, as outlined in the Bhagavad Gita 
    Knowledge, as understood my Socrates in knowledge as virtue.
    Habit as knowledge.
