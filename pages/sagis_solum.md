### # A bit of philosophy for Sabi 
The poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht, a committed Marxist, had anticipated this bleak assessment of culture. His notion of ‘epic theatre’ sought to reverse the ideological grip of traditional, ‘culinary theatre’, which Brecht despised for the way it fostered empathetic identification with dramatic characters. In response, Brecht developed what he called a Verfremdungseffekt or ‘estrangement effect’ to disrupt precisely this pattern (the German Verfremdung was a variant of Entfremdung, the term normally translated as alienation). Actors refused to conceal the fact that they were acting, and they frequently breached the fourth wall separating the stage from the audience in order to foreground the artifice of the production.

Close the first one with this. 

Sabi meets Daxi in a theater, before a play. Daxi's at the bar.
    “you come here often?” ; it's Sabi, but without her «quotation marks». Say something about how i spoil my readers with my quotation marks.
    The play begins. This one was written by Sabi. The curtains draw back, and there's Sabi on stage. At a bar. Daxi walks on, and asks “you come here often?”
    Sabi tiene to daxi and says «i fucking hate it here. I don't know why I'm here. It's out of character for me to be here.»
    „but you're here. Something about this place must agree with you, or you wouldn't be here.“
    Themes:
    Knowledge is virtue
    Human character : is a human character? The resulting of the human to the character, as outlined in the above article.
    Desire, as outlined in the Bhagavad Gita 
    Knowledge, as understood my Socrates in knowledge as virtue.
    Habit as knowledge.
### She felt as though the Aesthetic she embodied perfectly matched the Aesthetic of the situation. She and the stage on which she performed were two manifestations of the same feel; the lines between the two were as sharp as ever, and yet invisible:not because of their translucency, but because of how well they blended in. The two almost seemed like the same thing, more than the same feel: two parts of a bigger picture.
The feeling was—sublime.
### Aljedaxi  
Al : the
Je : manifestation, avatar of
Daxi : the force, the principle, the book, that which puts the daxi in the daxīn.
### I am not
>For people who feel long-term that their body does not match their internal sense of gender, it is not a choice. It is a burden they didn't choose, and they need professional and social support.

>I've known plenty of transmen and women
>and genderqueer people and I honestly
>can't imagine someone who is
>"legitimately" trans surviving past 25
>without transitioning or killing
>themselves. Dysphoria is that intense.
### some cat
               with the pen name 'daxi'. 
unless that is their name.
   maybe
  they're just always a pen.
### Brightness of prose ( [[tasting]] ) 
…the brightness of the prose is staring to get to me."

"brightness? Not sugariness?" 

Sugariness hurts the stomach. Brightness hurts the eyes.
### Brush  
… Daxi walks in, sits on the couch and pulls out a brush. sabi just curls up on her lap, like
> Daxi starts brushing sabi's hair, and it's then you realize {that the way the brush is made, it's probably very pleasant on the scalp; the brush was made for cats}. „everyone around here's got a bit of it in them“ she says; doesn't usually wear eyeliner but you notice, this time, her eyes

> „it's something in the air;something in the ink that runs through our veins. Everyone's a little…feline.“
### # Carol  
Consider this Carol Carol—the fetishized Carol—to be a character. And she is a point in a graph.

Fetishism is moving away from the herbal forum towards a particular manifestation. Instead of looking for the most beautiful, we instead limit ourselves to the most beautiful Korean, regardless of, say, whether there is a more beautiful white woman or not.
    it would be fine too say “a 10/10 white woman is, to me, the equivalent of a 7/10 Korean”. that is simply knowing one's tastes. The problem, however, lies in prestiging one group over another even when the proper weights are put in place.
    as per usual, there is a problem with brutal honesty, following your desires precisely: what are you to go for in the end? Our system is set up such that you make choice, and stick with it. 
    Pair bonding. But we are surrounded by choices. This is where fetishism comes in handy: my obsession with Carol books me to her. What if i went for every qt that day across from me on the train? This can be mirrored in daxi's paralysis. All these characters, deeply in love, paralyzed by the Excrucior, the pulling in all directions—
    Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity. 


When we manifest that character in the character Carol, consider how Daxi—who, in Canon, wrote the tractati—would react to this character she wrote, but never knew. 

So, we'll manifest this character Carol on the levels of daxi, Chaghaybou, and Daxi.
### Che Fece ... Il Gran Refiuto 
BY C. P. CAVAFY
TRANSLATED BY EDMUND KEELEY

For some people the day comes
when they have to declare the great Yes
or the great No. It’s clear at once who has the Yes
ready within him; and saying it,

he goes from honor to honor, strong in his conviction.
He who refuses does not repent. Asked again,
he’d still say no. Yet that no—the right no—
drags him down all his life.

## AP|PA manifesto 

…in this sense, the aesthetic philosopher of which I speak is greater than that of the past, for when the latter merely states their statement, the former *makes* it. Their statement is *manifest* in their work; it rings out in all elements—the thematic, pragmatic—and—of course, Aesthetic—in perfect harmony. 
It's like if, instead of writing the Communist manifesto, Marx simply went out and created a Communist society. This is the power we hold in our hands, and yet, so many refuse to use.
