### # A bit of philosophy for Sabi 
The poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht, a committed Marxist, had anticipated this bleak assessment of culture. His notion of ‘epic theatre’ sought to reverse the ideological grip of traditional, ‘culinary theatre’, which Brecht despised for the way it fostered empathetic identification with dramatic characters. In response, Brecht developed what he called a Verfremdungseffekt or ‘estrangement effect’ to disrupt precisely this pattern (the German Verfremdung was a variant of Entfremdung, the term normally translated as alienation). Actors refused to conceal the fact that they were acting, and they frequently breached the fourth wall separating the stage from the audience in order to foreground the artifice of the production.

Close the first one with this. 

Sabi meets Daxi in a theater, before a play. Daxi's at the bar.
    “you come here often?” ; it's Sabi, but without her «quotation marks». Say something about how i spoil my readers with my quotation marks.
    The play begins. This one was written by Sabi. The curtains draw back, and there's Sabi on stage. At a bar. Daxi walks on, and asks “you come here often?”
    Sabi tiene to daxi and says «i fucking hate it here. I don't know why I'm here. It's out of character for me to be here.»
    „but you're here. Something about this place must agree with you, or you wouldn't be here.“
    Themes:
    Knowledge is virtue
    Human character : is a human character? The resulting of the human to the character, as outlined in the above article.
    Desire, as outlined in the Bhagavad Gita 
    Knowledge, as understood my Socrates in knowledge as virtue.
    Habit as knowledge.
### She felt as though the Aesthetic she embodied perfectly matched the Aesthetic of the situation. She and the stage on which she performed were two manifestations of the same feel; the lines between the two were as sharp as ever, and yet invisible:not because of their translucency, but because of how well they blended in. The two almost seemed like the same thing, more than the same feel: two parts of a bigger picture.
The feeling was—sublime.
### Aljedaxi  
Al : the
Je : manifestation, avatar of
Daxi : the force, the principle, the book, that which puts the daxi in the daxīn.
### I am not
>For people who feel long-term that their body does not match their internal sense of gender, it is not a choice. It is a burden they didn't choose, and they need professional and social support.

>I've known plenty of transmen and women

>can't imagine someone who is
>"legitimately" trans surviving past 25
>without transitioning or killing

unless that is their name.
   maybe
  they're just always a pen.
# Brightness of prose 
…the brightness of the prose is staring to get to me."

"brightness? Not sugariness?" 

Sugariness hurts the stomach. Brightness hurts the eyes.
## AP|PA manifesto 

…in this sense, the aesthetic philosopher of which I speak is greater than that of the past, for when the latter merely states their statement, the former *makes* it. Their statement is *manifest* in their work; it rings out in all elements—the thematic, pragmatic—and—of course, Aesthetic—in perfect harmony. 
It's like if, instead of writing the Communist manifesto, Marx simply went out and created a Communist society. This is the power we hold in our hands, and yet, so many refuse to use.
