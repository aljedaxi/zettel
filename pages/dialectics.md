## synthesis should be understood as a system in dynamic equalibrium: the point of understanding hovering within the mess of the rhizome
## any *dia*lectical view of history is necessarily arborescent
## the hermeneutic cycle is as such:
- shared understanding <> abstract
- inquiry <> negation
- clarification <> concrete
