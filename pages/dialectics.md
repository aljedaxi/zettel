title: dialectics
---

- synthesis should be understood as a system in dynamic equalibrium: the point of understanding hovering within the mess of the rhizome
- any *dia*lectical view of history is necessarily arborescent
- the hermeneutic cycle is as such:
- shared understanding <> abstract
- inquiry <> negation
- clarification <> concrete
- while Plato uses Socrates as a character to prove philosophical points, Socrates does the same thing with all his interlocutors.
    - the platonic and socratic projects always have ends (Good) in sight: and all the men and women—even the philosophers—are merely players.
    - dialectic is never an open hearted search for truth, but somebody birthing their truth in another's head
- TODO thinking is dialectical in nature; all thinking is a bouncing around of ideas
