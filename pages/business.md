title: business

- ontology, relative to the business, is epistemological, cybernetic: the flow of [[techne]] through the system
- the goal of The Firm is to concentrate [[techne]]
  - somewhere in the firm, [[techne]] is synthesized from individual techne, the techne of the particular tool, the end, into a collective techne, wielded by the firm
    - the Department melds techne ; the tools of the department should facilitate these syntheses
  - if you start your business by reformatting the problems of the most sophisticated agents in the problem space, you can leverage their existing techne
  - flows of techne
- the form of the businessman is functionally equivalent to the form of the conman: the difference is what they're peddling
