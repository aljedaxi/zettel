## [Time management, in brief, is a decision-making framework that helps us structure, protect and adapt our time in changing circumstances. It can therefore be measured through questions like “do you have a daily routine?”, “do you find it hard to say no to people?” and “do you evaluate your daily schedule?”. Work-life balance and attitudes to time and time management are also key.](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/15/good-time-management-seems-to-have-a-bigger-impact-on-wellbeing-than-work-performance/)
