- the primary complaints:
> The integrity and trust of the entire software industry has sharply declined due to cryptocurrency. It sets up perverse incentives for new projects, where developers are no longer trying to convince you to use their software because it’s good, but because they think that if they can convince you it will make them rich [source](https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/26/Cryptocurrency-is-a-disaster.html#fnref:2)
> What “value” does solving fake math problems actually provide to anyone? [source](https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/26/Cryptocurrency-is-a-disaster.html#fnref:2)
> Every comment online about cryptocurrency is tainted by the fact that the commenter has probably invested thousands of dollars into a Ponzi scheme and is depending on your agreement to make their money back [source](https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/26/Cryptocurrency-is-a-disaster.html#fnref:2)
