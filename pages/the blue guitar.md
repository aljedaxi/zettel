    The Blue Guitar

the cloud wend, unwound 
the wings of a moth;      & the fur
went&wound 'pon the soil. 
the cloud sought—and caught—the soul
of the sun;the soil sang,and
           glimmered:
                     „what light!“
                                 ❦
                     „what light!
                     „what dear figure!
                     „what
      „zing!“sang the moth,
  their soul sanguine, suckling the sun;
      „what life! what is bigger, more
      „real?“rang the moth,
      „than this wellspring, this giver,
      „the light?“
                  ❦
    „quite right!“clang the sunshine,    
    enfolding the moth; all wrapped
    in the weft of their wing—
       the moth stole its vigor:
       its lifeblood, its light:
       & shone scarlet seascapes
          'till night. 
        ❦
     the sun sat beside me;
     the sun saw my plight
         and it plucked a prime poem
                of psych;
    'pon pleats of perplexity—
               woven in light—
         —here—there—inside
              buffèd sight. 
                 ❦
    "such a sight!" sang the sunshine,
          &       marked out the moth,
                         & eventually,
                          even my eye:
    "we are light":
                   we,   the whelming, 
                   in   earth,sun&sky:
                 sensing,suit upping
                        sublime.

                  ⁂ 

      » whither wander wild
 clouds?« „they clutch tight the cobble
      stones“ ; & hang a hoary ,
     holy hymn, ' pon this town,
    in the air of the throne .

    » whence 've went
             the wild  -  ery heights?
         of a London that never i knew? «
     „it fell in          
         through the height of the mind:
              in the morning—each morning
                            —'s new dew. “

       »what unwinds where winter
  sleeps?« „warm weather;still feathers;
            soft sheets ; 
            a whelming, winding, 
          warming world ;
               you stalk—
         , but can never quite reach.“

     » won't you wend your wary ways?
     you wild-witted, willowous weft? 
    weave but a word;
                     cobble it clear;
   that i might know this city, your dear.
     «     „water wraps the city round
           &under;&over;a bridge;;;;;;
  seek ye the wisdom of current-creek,
                                cloud?
        seek the sights—& the heights
                      —of the ridge.  “
