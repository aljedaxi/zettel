title: How to deconstruct the world

##
> consensus [of the [[neurotypical]]] is called the doxa (from where we get ‘orthodoxy’), and is contrasted with episteme, knowledge
##
> To think deconstructively is to not only call into question accepted truths, but to ask in whose interests it is that they be accepted
## 
> Next, look for places within the text that contradict each other, and where the spirit of the text is actually different ... we’ve become increasingly familiar with the idea of the ‘white saviour’ narrative ... Films ... purport to examine racial stereotypes ... but then use those ... stereotypes ... a white protagonist ... go[es] on a ‘journey’ of understanding, with the oppressed characters becoming objectified in the exact same way as what the film purports to be critiquing

> Derrida saw this kind of reading as reading against the grain. Take a text, find what it seems to advocate, and look in the opposite direction. G W F Hegel wrote about spirit, untainted by the mess of life – so Derrida explored his relationship to family.
##
> This doesn’t eliminate the text or the thinking, but it problematises them, it finds the limits. In a sense, we’re to treat every text with suspicion, although Derrida himself called this an act of ‘hospitality’. To read a text this closely is to treat it with seriousness, to really look at what’s going on.

> Patients in analysis reveals their truth not simply in the words they use, but in the words they don’t, in the stutters and repetitions, in the times they try to laugh things off, and when they contradict themselves. The ‘self’ being whole and coherent is an act of will. For Derrida, the ‘text’ being whole is the same.

> ‘hauntology’, a pun on the word ontology. Ontology is the philosophical investigation of what there is. Hauntology is the philosophical investigation of what there isn’t.
