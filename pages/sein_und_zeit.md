##
> for everyone uses it constantly and already understands what he means by it 21
socrates was all about people use language without understanding what it means
##
> an **understanding** of being is already included in conceiving of anything which one apprehends as an entity [22]

##
> "the sky *is* blue" 23
well, maybe it is in english, but is it so in spanish?
## analysis of the form of inquiry yeilds:
sein *Gefragtes*
: that which is asked about

ein *Befragtes*
: that which is interrogated, the source

das *Erfragtes*
: the end of the asking
##
> so the meaning of being must already be available to us in some way 25
