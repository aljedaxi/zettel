##
> ... the question of being
what is the question?
##
> for everyone uses it constantly and already understands what he means by it 21
socrates was all about people use language without understanding what it means
##
> an **understanding** of being is already included in conceiving of anything which one apprehends as an entity [22]
again, a theory of being is presupposed but not understood
##
> "the sky *is* blue" 23
well, maybe it is in english, but is it so in spanish?
## analysis of the form of inquiry yeilds:
sein *Gefragtes*
: that which is asked about

ein *Befragtes*
: that which is interrogated, the source

das *Erfragtes*
: the end of the asking
##
> so the meaning of being must already be available to us in some way [25]
## being, in being prior to the realm of entities, cannot be understood by tracing the chain of causality through entities
### something about form and energy; being is that which is being reformatted, and thence cannot be found in the formations and reformations
logical leap, we don't know what being is yet
## alienation
### in marxism, alienation is a social thing
### in heidegger, alienation
## we have to interrogate Being through entities
### entities are our *Befragtes*
### which entities?
### only we can ask the question
