- One might say there's only one aesthesis:  capital S 'Sensation', and all other aestheses are implied by it. eg, 'Σ'⊃'it feels like evening'. 
- Σ because it's the summation of all things currently sensed. The summation of a sensory fields.
- The only aesthesis is Σ. Everything else is post hoc analysis.
- There's a certain fuzziness that true aestheses have. The more accurately you define the edges, the larger it must be. The fuzzier you define the edges, the smaller it can get. 
- the size is the territory, and the fuzziness of its definition, are inversely proportional.
- We must remember that unity is not about 'oneness'. Unity is about transcending number altogether.
