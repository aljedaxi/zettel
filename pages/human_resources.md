## domain driven design: what's the domain of the function? what're the things that you need to know about?
### eg, sales, is both a skill, but you're selling all the domains of the product
## functions
### a 'Function' is an organizational entity, typically characterized by a special area of knowledge or experience. Examples would be a team operating the SAP environment, a software development department, or - to name a function outside of the IT organization - a Human Resources (HR) department. ITIL 'Processes', in contrast, are clusters of activities which produce a defined outcome, like the ITIL Incident Management process.
