## Stories
### Ashby and decision making

> Ashby ... "Well I would have thought you would have said, give me three months and I'll list all the pros and cons and then make a balanced judgement". 
> ... "What, have you taken leave of your senses. ... It's an impossible assignment ... ". "It's difficult, I know, I've been trying to do that myself after all. Why did you just say yes?" 
> " ... if you don't have enough information" ... "you obey hunch, now, the brain is a complicated piece of machinery and might produce the right answer. I can't account for it. My brain said do it, so I did." ... "okay say you don't have a hunch, what is  the second most obvious thing to do." 
> He looked at me most pityingly and said "you toss a coin". It is  the only rational thing to do.
