Error Control Negative Feedback
: when you feed the error percentage back into the input

Synergy
: the energy available from the syn. Putting things together.

Transfer Function
: You go from this box to this box what happens here is mathematically a transfer function this is  an input to that, and the transference has some kind of characteristics which is mathematically a transfer function

Variety
: the number of possible states within a system

Model
: that which replaces Reality; Reality && Observer
## People:
Warren McCulloch
: Blacksmith, physician, friends w einstein

Norbert Weiner
: The mathematician that wrote Cybernetics
: Developed Fourier analysis
: "The American Leibniz"

Ross Ashby
: invented the term variety
## Session 1
### 
> the whole essence of Cybernetics is the lesson of never do anything until you know the result of your last action
### 
> that word steersman appears in Homer, Plato uses it for regulation in societies. .. in Latin ... Greek Kappa turns into a G a harder sound and out of Kybernetes you get gubernator
### 
> intrinsic regulation. The regulation is in the system.
the trick is to build governance into the system
###
> Cybernetics ... the science of control and communication in the animal and machine
- animal and machine implies that the two use the same mechanisms
- implies control is a function of comms, & even that they're the same
### Stories
#### Ashby and decision making

> Ashby ... "Well I would have thought you would have said, give me three months and I'll list all the pros and cons and then make a balanced judgement". 
> ... "What, have you taken leave of your senses. ... It's an impossible assignment ... ". "It's difficult, I know, I've been trying to do that myself after all. Why did you just say yes?" 
> " ... if you don't have enough information" ... "you obey hunch, now, the brain is a complicated piece of machinery and might produce the right answer. I can't account for it. My brain said do it, so I did." ... "okay say you don't have a hunch, what is  the second most obvious thing to do." 
> He looked at me most pityingly and said "you toss a coin". It is  the only rational thing to do.
#### The Fourth Layer of the visual cortex

> McCulloch walked into the common room of this place in the evening and there was Norbert Weiner sitting there, reading and Warren said ... you've got all these blind people who can't see, I'm trying to make a machine to enable them to read with their ears
> ... scan the print with a photo-electric cell which ... is going to encounter this I when this line is broken it makes a sound and when it encounters the 1 this line is broken it makes a different sound.
> ... If we have The solids are photo electric cells and the circles are oscillators. You set up a  vibration between a  photo electric cell and oscillator ... this is not a circuit you see. It is a schematic diagram of how you would do this. 
> Warren pours himself a  large whisky ... Goes off to bed, and leaves the drawing on the table. Now in comes Gerhardt von Bonin ... He picks this up and says to Norbert Weiner "whose been trying to make a diagram of the fourth visual layer of the cortex?"
> Weiner ... [the] next time the group got together for one of their regular evening meetings ... said he could make a mathematical analysis of this so called machine or this so called bit of brain if I knew the rate at which nerve impulses are coming up here if I  could quantify the diagram in short. So various people say I've spent a lifetime doing that I can tell you that the impulses come in and they did quantify the diagram. Weiner did the maths and he said I can now tell you what the scanning rhythm has to be.
> It's ten cycles. What is that? ... the alpha state of the brain. Which is the resting rhythm of the brain. Which has solemnly scanning this stuff at ten cycles per second.
### 
> ... they talked a lot at night
> ... the things that matter most to science, to philosophy, to human race are issues which fall between the stools of established subjects
> ... university is supposed to be that it is universal, it  is holistic and you couldn't find a  more reductionist and non-holistic place
> ... what sort of topic might pervade everything and not be recognised because of this reductionism. They came up with the notion of control.
#### does liberalism render analysis of control taboo?
#### 
> Einstein's great problem, if I  may say that about the great man, was precisely that he wasn't inter-disciplinary at all ... You see the answer to that is you need to be a logician to answer that the answer to that is God is the dice, and there is no problem any longer.
## Session 2
### 
> I worked a lot for the native Indians in Canada, who are faced with this kind of systemic dilemma ... we are [[guilt]]y of genocide which isn't a very good start because people are terribly guilty ...
> ... what percentage of this enormous amount of money do you think is  spent on administration?" ... 85%.
### 
> The Jacquard Loom ... that was responsible of course for all the revolts under the name of Luddites.
### People didn't know much about Turing in the 90s
### 
> The so-called Leo machine which was the office machine. The first computer was run in Manchester University, and it  beat the Americans to it because the American machine didn't have storage
###
> Grey Walter ... was the man who invented the mechanical tortoise ... Mechinaspeculartrix ... You imagine a little thing like this, looking like a ouiji board, with three wheels. You have two wheels on the back which drive the thing, with a little electric motor and one wheel on the front which swivels round ... On top of the front wheel is a photo cell again. This thing now has an eye with one input, either this photo cell is firing or it isn't. So it's like a periscope. This means that if you shine a light at this thing it will follow you. ... Now it is  following the light with its periscope and it hits something and it short circuits the shell against the chassis. Turns the photo cell into an oscillator, the result is that, the engine starts reversing and going forward and it  feels its way round the obstruction. You lead it into the furniture, deliberately and then it works its way round it and comes after you again. Now, with only have two cells. We've got a very biological looking machine on our hands ... he put an ordinary torch bulb a  low circuit thing on a  battery inside the shell which tested the circuits so that if the machine was still active when it  stopped, then the light came on ... Here are two  machines, wandering about, they hit each other, so they retreat at the moment they're still, both their lights come therefore, the two photo cells ... this is a courting dance. Any decent biologist would tell you that these things were about to mate.
#### 
> It's interesting, such a simple little thing, is so out of keeping with what we think of as machines
###
> Cartesian philosophy dominated the French culture. Was the ultimately reductionist thing. The French have been hugely conditioned by this reduction approach.
### 
> Now how are you going to define the railways of Canada as a system? ... What is a railway? If I don't even own all this hardware what is  it actually about ... So as soon as you start thinking about the real systemic character of this. You are trying to sell tickets to people who want to go from A to B and nothing of that has anything to do with the railway, except that at some point between A and B there may be a chunk of railway that you can use ... If you want to take the train, you're going to have to get to the station then get transport at the other end. That's what I mean by a  system. You are looking at the operational reality of what you are trying to do and not what somebody says to you is "Oh there's the railway" ... What I'm arguing is  that we are always dealing with little bits of what is the relevant system because it's convenient, and it's convenient to measure it  in terms of money ... What we have to do is loosen up our notions of what a system might be and look at the reality. Look at the operational reality.
###
## Session 3
### Traditional managerial science has the problem of trying to measure "Men, Materials, Machinery and Money"; of course, all those are relevant only insofar as they are the things which become complexly intertangled
###
> how many states can you distinguish?
### "The System" is epistemological
The Observer is a part of the system
### In the 30s, Einstein was considered insane
