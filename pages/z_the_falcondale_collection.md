: when you feed the error percentage back into the input

Synergy
: the energy available from the syn. Putting things together.

Norbert Weiner
: The mathematician that wrote Cybernetics
: Developed Fourier analysis
: "The American Leibniz"
## Session 1
### 
> the whole essence of Cybernetics is the lesson of never do anything until you know the result of your last action
### 
> that word steersman appears in Homer, Plato uses it for regulation in societies. .. in Latin ... Greek Kappa turns into a G a harder sound and out of Kybernetes you get gubernator
### 
> intrinsic regulation. The regulation is in the system.
the trick is to build governance into the system
###
> Cybernetics ... the science of control and communication in the animal and machine
- animal and machine implies that the two use the same mechanisms
- implies control is a function of comms, & even that they're the same
### Stories
#### Ashby and decision making

> Ashby ... "Well I would have thought you would have said, give me three months and I'll list all the pros and cons and then make a balanced judgement". 
> ... "What, have you taken leave of your senses. ... It's an impossible assignment ... ". "It's difficult, I know, I've been trying to do that myself after all. Why did you just say yes?" 
> " ... if you don't have enough information" ... "you obey hunch, now, the brain is a complicated piece of machinery and might produce the right answer. I can't account for it. My brain said do it, so I did." ... "okay say you don't have a hunch, what is  the second most obvious thing to do." 
> He looked at me most pityingly and said "you toss a coin". It is  the only rational thing to do.
#### The Fourth Layer of the visual cortex

> McCulloch walked into the common room of this place in the evening and there was Norbert Weiner sitting there, reading and Warren said ... you've got all these blind people who can't see, I'm trying to make a machine to enable them to read with their ears
> ... scan the print with a photo-electric cell which ... is going to encounter this I when this line is broken it makes a sound and when it encounters the 1 this line is broken it makes a different sound.
> ... If we have The solids are photo electric cells and the circles are oscillators. You set up a  vibration between a  photo electric cell and oscillator ... this is not a circuit you see. It is a schematic diagram of how you would do this. 
> Warren pours himself a  large whisky ... Goes off to bed, and leaves the drawing on the table. Now in comes Gerhardt von Bonin ... He picks this up and says to Norbert Weiner "whose been trying to make a diagram of the fourth visual layer of the cortex?"
> Weiner ... [the] next time the group got together for one of their regular evening meetings ... said he could make a mathematical analysis of this so called machine or this so called bit of brain if I knew the rate at which nerve impulses are coming up here if I  could quantify the diagram in short. So various people say I've spent a lifetime doing that I can tell you that the impulses come in and they did quantify the diagram. Weiner did the maths and he said I can now tell you what the scanning rhythm has to be.
> It's ten cycles. What is that? ... the alpha state of the brain. Which is the resting rhythm of the brain. Which has solemnly scanning this stuff at ten cycles per second.
### 
> ... they talked a lot at night
> ... the things that matter most to science, to philosophy, to human race are issues which fall between the stools of established subjects
> ... university is supposed to be that it is universal, it  is holistic and you couldn't find a  more reductionist and non-holistic place
> ... what sort of topic might pervade everything and not be recognised because of this reductionism. They came up with the notion of control.
#### does liberalism render analysis of control taboo?
#### 
> Einstein's great problem, if I  may say that about the great man, was precisely that he wasn't inter-disciplinary at all ... You see the answer to that is you need to be a logician to answer that the answer to that is God is the dice, and there is no problem any longer.
## Session 2
### 
> I worked a lot for the native Indians in Canada, who are faced with this kind of systemic dilemma ... we are [[guilt]]y of genocide which isn't a very good start because people are terribly guilty ...
> ... what percentage of this enormous amount of money do you think is  spent on administration?" ... 85%.
### 
> The Jacquard Loom ... that was responsible of course for all the revolts under the name of Luddites.
### People didn't know much about Turing in the 90s
### 
> The so-called Leo machine which was the office machine. The first computer was run in Manchester University, and it  beat the Americans to it because the American machine didn't have storage
### 
> Grey Walter ... was the man who invented the mechanical tortoise ... Mechinaspeculartrix ... You imagine a little thing like this, looking like a ouiji board, with three wheels. You have two wheels on the back which drive the thing, with a little electric motor and one wheel on the front which swivels round ... On top of the front wheel is a photo cell again. This thing now has an eye with one input, either this photo cell is firing or it isn't. So it's like a periscope. This means that if you shine a light at this thing it will follow you.
