> I have wondered alot about this week, as to how far I can go into. For instance I worked a lot for the native Indians in Canada, who are faced with this kind of systemic dilemma. That everybody says, okay  we are guilty of genocide which isn't a very good start because people are terribly guilty, as they are in the United States as you know Catherine. 
> It was absolutely bizarre and I said "You have got the whole of the press up against you because of this dilemma and you haven't even seen it and you are spending all this money and the citizen can't seeing any result. Why is this? Here is your balance sheet, published, what percentage of this enormous amount of money do you think is  spent on administration?" ... 85%.
