- A different way to categorize existentialism is as a subset of phenomenology.
- Kierkegaard himself understood that all of despair does not follow directly from christianity.
- one despairs *over* that which binds one to despair
one despairs *of* that which releases one from despair
- despair -> despondency -> depression
  - Despair is pain arising from the idea of something past or future, wherefrom all cause of doubt has been removed. [www.ethicadb.org/pars.php?parid=3&lanid=3&lg=en]
- seriousness as a sort of authenticity
  - what will The Outside say of you, your self?
- the relationship of freedom to goodness:
milton speaks freedom in terms of djin,
while Spinoza speaks of freedom *as* good
