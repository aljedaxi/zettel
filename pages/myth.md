## Historian and University of Manitoba professor Adele Perry wrote in an op-ed for the Winnipeg Free Press that it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that Canadians began to commemorate Macdonald as the founder of Canada. Macdonald’s face didn’t even appear on the $10 bill until 1971. 

Perry argues that these commemorative acts at this time in Canada’s history “mainly tell us about the aspirations and anxieties of some English-speaking Canadians” during a period “marked by Québécois nationalism, Indigenous resistance, the challenges of feminism and a Canada that was less and less white.”

## the ironic [[mode]] must be weaponized in service of sincerity
## the rise of the shrek-style antihero represents the beginning of the meta-modern mode
### the transition innocence -> anti-hero -> hero is a recapitulation of the phygenetic transition modernity -> postmodernity -> metamodernity
## the ironic mode must be weaponized in service of sincerity
## Are not only for me 

The clouds paint the sky with a scant urgency,
The stony–bed rivers do warble gladly,
The grasses, they sing in so many a key,
And the stars are not only/simply for me

And the stars shine for more than just me

Und die Sterne sind nicht für nur mich
