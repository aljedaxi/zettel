- Introduction: What this book is about
	- self organization emerges from individuals acting only w their closest neighbors. data riples through local connections.
	- Organizers see & reach beyond their neighbors.
		- Organization is characterized by awareness, [[intention]], and access 
		  
		  awareness
		  : organizers need to be aware of more than just their immediate neighbors, to inform their plans
		  
		  intention
		  : intention is a partial function of what information the actor acted with; "the ability to make plans and carry them out"
		  
		  access
		  : the ability to enact plans
	- Consider the city center: each building was organized relative to itself, but perhaps not to others
	- The intentionality of organization & the unintentionality of self-organization clash in [[the absurd]]
- quibbles:
	-
	  > an organizer doesn't need to know why it is organizing things to be organizing them. A fish building a circular mating mound has no ida why the mound has to be circular ... But it know that it wants to build a circular mound --- and that's [[intention]]
- One way to draw the [[VSM]] would be to put all management in the middle of the circle, then have the red squiggly lines be betwixt all viable systems that make up system one
