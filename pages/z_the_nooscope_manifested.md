title: The Nooscope Manifested

## the optical instrument acted as knowledge magnification insofar as it expanded the realm of digestible data; thence, equivalence classes.

> In the same way that the lenses of microscopes and telescopes are never perfectly curvilinear and smooth, the logical lenses of machine learning embody faults and biases. To understand machine learning ... is to study the degree by which social data are diffracted and distorted by these lenses.
##
> As an instrument of knowledge, machine learning is composed of an object to be observed (training dataset), an instrument of observation (learning algorithm) and a final representation (statistical model). The assemblage of these three elements is proposed here as a spurious and baroque diagram of machine learning, extravagantly termed Nooscope.
## the statistical model is a means by which representations of the world can be created. just as a lens can be moved about to represent different worlds in different eyes, the model may be used to represent any input.
