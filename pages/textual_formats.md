## Have the various parts. Summarize each part in one sentence, such that all of them can fit on one page. Then introduce layers of nuance, but by bit, around each other, sub doctrines unfolding out of and around each other, each one helping to feed into an understanding of the other.

At the end, have a poem that "quotes" various portions of the text â€” to that you can go back and see it isn't there, but something similar. The quoted and quote dance.
