> The Greeks call the act of bringing something to appearance “poiêsis.” The craftsman takes his place in poiêsis through a specific type of knowledge called technê that allows him to gather the other causes and bring the work to completion. Technê is thus a mode of revealing insofar as it places the finished work before us, making it present. This Greek mode of revealing Heidegger calls a “bringing forth,” a “Her-vor-bringen”  (QCT, 10).

one can think of the xenofeminist appropriation of heideggerian language as an appropriation of heideggers technologies.
