> The Greeks call the act of bringing something to appearance “poiêsis.” The craftsman takes his place in poiêsis through a specific type of knowledge called technê that allows him to gather the other causes and bring the work to completion. Technê is thus a mode of revealing insofar as it places the finished work before us, making it present. This Greek mode of revealing Heidegger calls a “bringing forth,” a “Her-vor-bringen”  (QCT, 10).

one can think of the xenofeminist appropriation of heideggerian language as an appropriation of heideggers technologies.

the proximal understanding of flexibility that one acheives from using the command line recapitulates the understanding one needs to be a successful programmer

it really dramatically changes the way you relate to technology
