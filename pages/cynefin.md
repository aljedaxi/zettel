## Complex is when you don't know what you're doing, but you have the capacity to probe safely
### your outcome in those situations is a function of [[organizational culture]]
## Chaos is when you can't fail safely
### If you want violent revolution, the totality of people's lives must be thrust into chaos
####
## disorder is when you don't know what domain you're in, and you act in accordance with whatever domain speaks most to you
