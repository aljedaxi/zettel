what the actual fuck
- inner essence of nature $$\equiv$$ connatus
- oh this actually just is Freud's otogeny recapitulates phylogeny
but it can't be, because *On the Origin of Species* was published in 1859, and the Third and Final edition of *Die Welt als Wille und Forstellung* was published in 1859.
