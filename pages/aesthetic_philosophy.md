## Aesthetics emerges from the forms, from energy, information. 
the aesthesis is the bundle of information, the informatic quanta; the first derivative of the form.
## A chair is a complex system. What emerges from the form of the chair---the aesthetic of chair---is the aesthesis of chair? the aesthetic of chair.
## To attempt an understanding without a definition is folly; to attempt a definition without an understanding is folly.
