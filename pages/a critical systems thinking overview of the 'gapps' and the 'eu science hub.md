## Definitions

VUCA 
: volatile,  uncertain,  complex,  ambiguous

GAPPS 
: Global Alliance for the Project Professions
## 
> VUCA ... arise  from  dynamic  interdependencies,  within  and  between  systems,  and  the existence  of  multiple  stakeholders  with  differing  perspectives

> its underlying world-view as being that 'complexity is the issue  and  systems  thinking  the  way  forward'
### 
> At  the  heart  of  the framework  are  5  'Units  of  Competency'  in  the  workplace, incorporating   22   elements   of   competency   and   81   criteria   of   threshold performance.  
> - 'Think  Holistically',  is  about  applying  appropriate systems  approaches  in  the  face  of  dynamic  interrelationships  and  multiple perspectives,  and  emerging  threats  and  opportunities.  
> - 'Exercise Personal  Mastery',  deals  with  the  qualities  a  leader,  confronted  by  complexity, should demonstrate in their personal behaviour, in building trust, and in leading sensitively.  
> - 'Provide  Conditions  to  Enable  Decisions  and  Action', concerns maintaining strategic direction, setting the minimal rules necessary to enable  action  (providing  scope  for  autonomy  and  self-organisation),  supplying data needs, and establishing control systems that contribute to learning. This unit also requires leaders to 'act sustainably', taking into account the UN's 'Sustainable Development  Goals'.  In  particular,  attention  must  be  given  to  the  impact  of decisions  on  individuals  and  teams,  the  community,  diversity,  society,  and  the environment.  
> - 'Respond  to  the  Environment',  demands  that  leaders establish   flexible   structures   and   processes,   and   continually   review   their assumptions in the light of new learning. 
> - 'Engage Collaboratively', requires  close  engagement  with  stakeholders,  working  across  boundaries  to ensure open communication, and collaborative teamwork which respects diverse perspectives.
### 
> But the framework makes it clear that it is concerned to set out 'what' needs  to  be  considered  in  dealing  with  complexity,  not  'how'  things  should  be done
###
>  The competencies  around  'Provide  Conditions  to  Enable  Decisions and  Action'  and 'Respond to the Environment' might usefully have been linked to the strengths of the  '[[viable system model]]'  and  '[[socio-technical systems thinking]]';  those  around 'Engage Collaboratively' with soft systems approaches;and those concerned with 'act  sustainably'  to  '[[critical systems heuristics]]'.

> It ... differs from the GAPPS framework in being praxis oriented ... Its world-view  is  that  complexityis  the  issue  and  decision-makers  are  better  placed  to navigate  complexity  if  they  employ  a  sensibility  and  methods  derived  from complexity theory
###
> other complexity and systems perspectives receive little attention. These include   natural science variants of complexity (such as developed at the Santa Fe Institute or  derived  from  Prigogine);  social  science variants   (interactionist,   radical   change,   postmodern,   critical   realist,   etc.) developed during complexity theory's promiscuous crawl through social theory; and cybernetic, soft systems, and critical systems approaches.
### 
> 'Assess'  starts  with  a  state  of  confusion  which  involves  deciding  whether  an apparent crisis can be managed using existing protocols or will demand radical change. If the latter, it is important to gain some initial control by adjusting the 'constraints' that are operating. In the case of Covid-19 (and this example is used to good effect throughout the document), this would translate into tightening them by closing borders, insisting on confinement, and encouraging social distancing and remote working. At the same time, it is crucial to start to move away from bureaucracy and conservative practices by delegating decision-making, creating more flexible boundaries to improve communication, and empowering informal networks.  Decision-makers  should  start  'journaling' -capturing  in  notebooks, using sketches as much as possible, the principles they are applying and the new relationships  that  develop.
