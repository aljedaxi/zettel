## Definitions

VUCA 
: volatile,  uncertain,  complex,  ambiguous

GAPPS 
: Global Alliance for the Project Professions
## 
> VUCA ... arise  from  dynamic  interdependencies,  within  and  between  systems,  and  the existence  of  multiple  stakeholders  with  differing  perspectives

> its underlying world-view as being that 'complexity is the issue  and  systems  thinking  the  way  forward'
### 
> At  the  heart  of  the framework  are  5  'Units  of  Competency'  in  the  workplace, incorporating   22   elements   of   competency   and   81   criteria   of   threshold performance.  
> - 'Think  Holistically',  is  about  applying  appropriate systems  approaches  in  the  face  of  dynamic  interrelationships  and  multiple perspectives,  and  emerging  threats  and  opportunities.  
> - 'Exercise Personal  Mastery',  deals  with  the  qualities  a  leader,  confronted  by  complexity, should demonstrate in their personal behaviour, in building trust, and in leading sensitively.  
> - 'Provide  Conditions  to  Enable  Decisions  and  Action', concerns maintaining strategic direction, setting the minimal rules necessary to enable  action  (providing  scope  for  autonomy  and  self-organisation),  supplying data needs, and establishing control systems that contribute to learning. This unit also requires leaders to 'act sustainably', taking into account the UN's 'Sustainable Development  Goals'.  In  particular,  attention  must  be  given  to  the  impact  of decisions  on  individuals  and  teams,  the  community,  diversity,  society,  and  the environment.  
> - 'Respond  to  the  Environment',  demands  that  leaders establish   flexible   structures   and   processes,   and   continually   review   their assumptions in the light of new learning. 
> - 'Engage Collaboratively', requires  close  engagement  with  stakeholders,  working  across  boundaries  to ensure open communication, and collaborative teamwork which respects diverse perspectives.
### 
> But the framework makes it clear that it is concerned to set out 'what' needs  to  be  considered  in  dealing  with  complexity,  not  'how'  things  should  be done
###
>  The competencies  around  'Provide  Conditions  to  Enable  Decisions and  Action'  and 'Respond to the Environment' might usefully have been linked to the strengths of the  '[[viable system model]]'  and  '[[socio-technical systems thinking]]';  those  around 'Engage Collaboratively' with soft systems approaches;and those concerned with 'act  sustainably'  to  '[[critical systems heuristics]]'.

> It ... differs from the GAPPS framework in being praxis oriented ... Its world-view  is  that  complexityis  the  issue  and  decision-makers  are  better  placed  to navigate  complexity  if  they  employ  a  sensibility  and  methods  derived  from complexity theory
###
> other complexity and systems perspectives receive little attention. These include   natural science variants of complexity (such as developed at the Santa Fe Institute or  derived  from  Prigogine);  social  science variants   (interactionist,   radical   change,   postmodern,   critical   realist,   etc.) developed during complexity theory's promiscuous crawl through social theory; and cybernetic, soft systems, and critical systems approaches.
### 
> Decision-makers are advised to navigate through crises by  adopting  a  4-stage  approach -'Assess',  'Adapt',  'Exapt',  and  'Transcend'
####
> 'Assess' starts with ... deciding whether an apparent crisis can be managed using existing protocols or will demand radical change. If the latter, it is important to gain some initial control by adjusting the 'constraints' that are operating. In the case of Covid-19 ... closing borders, insisting on confinement, and encouraging social distancing ... it is crucial to start to move away from bureaucracy and conservative practices by delegating decision-making, creating more flexible boundaries to improve communication, and empowering informal networks.  Decision-makers  should  start  'journaling' -capturing  in  notebooks, using sketches as much as possible, the principles they are applying and the new relationships  that  develop.
####
>  'Adapt'  is  about  managing  'emerging  evolutionary possibilities' ... This will require loosening organisational constraints and any narrative constraints which stand in the way of a wider variety of 'stories' coming forward. Overall co-ordination must be maintained but the organisation needs to become a distributed 'human sensor network' in which informal teams and various specialised 'crews' seek to reframe the problem space from diverse perspectives, react to weak signals, and seek out new  opportunities.  Prototyping  of  innovative  solutions  can  begin  but  the overarching mantra is to keep options open. Journaling is essential as a means of recording  lessons  learnt  and  sharing  insights.  ...  At  some  point  there is an 'aporetic turn', confusion begins to dissipate, and it becomes possible to produce a 'map' showing possible changes and how their impact can be  monitored. Potential solutions are evaluated, and resources allocated to the most promising.
#### 
> 'Exapt', sees action begin in earnest. 'Exapting' is a process of "radical  repurposing of roles, processes, paradigms, values". On the basis of a thorough  knowledge of the present, intervention strategies are designed which will create new processes and structures, and the new 'conceptual scaffoldings' necessary for the organisation to transform itself. To ensure that the questioning of existing  practices and conceptual boundaries is radical enough, it may be necessary to temporarily enter the domain of 'chaos'. Multiple contributions should be encouraged and orchestrated so that agreement is reached on actionable ideas which can be carried forward and tested.
#### 
> By the time the 'Transcend' stage is attained, the organisation is likely to have changed dramatically. It is necessary to consolidate and establish greater stability. The 'new normal' must build on the freshly developed activities, the shared learning that has been obtained, and the narratives and stories that correspond to and give coherence to the new present. People  will  be  acting  more  in  concert  but  must  still  maintain  the  'requisite diversity' necessary to respond to the next crisis.They will be stronger for having learnt from past failure
