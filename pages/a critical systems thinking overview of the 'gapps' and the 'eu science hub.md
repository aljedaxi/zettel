## Definitions

GAPPS 
: Global Alliance for the Project Professions
## VUCA ... arise  from  dynamic  interdependencies,  within  and  between  systems,  and  the existence  of  multiple  stakeholders  with  differing  perspectives
## 
> At  the  heart  of  the [GAPPS]  framework  are  5  'Units  of  Competency'  in  the  workplace, incorporating   22   elements   of   competency   and   81   criteria   of   threshold performance.  
> - 'Think  Holistically',  is  about  applying  appropriate systems  approaches  in  the  face  of  dynamic  interrelationships  and  multiple perspectives,  and  emerging  threats  and  opportunities.  
- 'Exercise Personal  Mastery',  deals  with  the  qualities  a  leader,  confronted  by  complexity, should demonstrate in their personal behaviour, in building trust, and in leading sensitively.  
- 'Provide  Conditions  to  Enable  Decisions  and  Action', concerns maintaining strategic direction, setting the minimal rules necessary to enable  action  (providing  scope  for  autonomy  and  self-organisation),  supplying data needs, and establishing control systems that contribute to learning. This unit also requires leaders to 'act sustainably', taking into account the UN's 'Sustainable Development  Goals'.  In  particular,  attention  must  be  given  to  the  impact  of decisions  on  individuals  and  teams,  the  community,  diversity,  society,  and  the environment.  
- 'Respond  to  the  Environment',  demands  that  leaders establish   flexible   structures   and   processes,   and   continually   review   their assumptions in the light of new learning. 
- 'Engage Collaboratively', requires  close  engagement  with  stakeholders,  working  across  boundaries  to ensure open communication, and collaborative teamwork which respects diverse perspectives.
