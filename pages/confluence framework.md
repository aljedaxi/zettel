title: confluence framework
---

## Confluence operates on two axes: imposed order and self-organization
## Confluence and Cynefin, where 
- the strength of the central authority recapitulates the strength of the constraints, ie, the extent to which existing techne has already been ossified into rules &c.
- the strength of the meshwork recapitulates the accessibility of techne from your teammates

> North is the direction of winter, night, old age, earth and the physical world. In the North a dominant central force -- age, cold, darkness, the laws of physics -- holds each constituent element in its grasp. Here everyone knows the answer, because there can be only one answer ... the power of new life beginning to throb through an apparently rotting seed .. animals huddling together for warmth, hunting together for food ... Dictators attempt to move the situation to the extreme bottomâ€“right corner [simple, known, the dead of winter] where they have absolute control and no other connections exist. Loyalty tests and other mind games are meant to sever nascent connections among the subjugated masses, especially those given subordinate power. However, keeping up such an unnatural situation requires a huge influx of energy, so these situations eventually implode through their own fragility
#### 
> The East is the direction of spring, sunrise, youth, air and the spiritual world. In the East old connections are broken and everything starts anew. Everyone is floating in the void, kings and paupers alike ... everything is fresh and new, when they can see the universe in a raindrop and spend hours looking at the beauty of a blade of grass ... The people associated with Wabun [the east] have wisdom, and the possibility of bringing illumination and enlightenment to themselves and those they touch ... [it is] uncanny, in that there is a potential for order but few can see it ... in chaotic space, a canny ability gets you nowhere (there is no system to be worked) ... Canny people tend to succeed in their own lifetimes; uncanny people tend to be recognized and appreciated only centuries later, because during their time their actions appeared to be either insane or pointless...
