title: confluence framework
---

## Confluence operates on two axes: imposed order and self-organization
## and the two recapitulate each other, where 
- the strength of the central authority recapitulates the strength of the constraints, ie, the extent to which existing techne has already been ossified into rules &c.
- the strength of the meshwork recapitulates the accessibility of techne from your teammates
thereby, "In Dave's known/simple domain, ... imposed order is high and the degree of self-organization is low. In the knowable/complicated domain, both imposition and self-organization are high. In the complex domain, self-organization is dominant; and in chaos neither are strong" [source](http://www.storycoloredglasses.com/2010/06/confluence.html)
