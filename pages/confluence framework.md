title: confluence framework
---

- Confluence operates on two axes: imposed order and self-organization
- Confluence and Cynefin, where 
- the strength of the central authority recapitulates the strength of the constraints, ie, the extent to which existing techne has already been ossified into rules &c.
- the strength of the meshwork recapitulates the accessibility of techne from your teammates

> North is the direction of winter, night, old age, earth and the physical world. In the North a dominant central force -- age, cold, darkness, the laws of physics -- holds each constituent element in its grasp. Here everyone knows the answer, because there can be only one answer ... the power of new life beginning to throb through an apparently rotting seed .. animals huddling together for warmth, hunting together for food ... Dictators attempt to move the situation to the extreme bottomâ€“right corner [simple, known, the dead of winter] where they have absolute control and no other connections exist. Loyalty tests and other mind games are meant to sever nascent connections among the subjugated masses, especially those given subordinate power. However, keeping up such an unnatural situation requires a huge influx of energy, so these situations eventually implode through their own fragility

> The East is the direction of spring, sunrise, youth, air and the spiritual world. In the East old connections are broken and everything starts anew. Everyone is floating in the void, kings and paupers alike ... everything is fresh and new, when they can see the universe in a raindrop and spend hours looking at the beauty of a blade of grass ... The people associated with Wabun [the east] have wisdom, and the possibility of bringing illumination and enlightenment to themselves and those they touch ... [it is] uncanny, in that there is a potential for order but few can see it ... in chaotic space, a canny ability gets you nowhere (there is no system to be worked) ... Canny people tend to succeed in their own lifetimes; uncanny people tend to be recognized and appreciated only centuries later, because during their time their actions appeared to be either insane or pointless ...

> South is the direction of summer, mid-day, young adulthood, water and the emotional world. In the South meshwork connections form and strengthen like growing plants. Here everyone has their own answer because everyone has their own path. This is the realm of storytelling, of mutual aid, and of learning by trial and error through probing explorations ... lessons of the spirit received during sleep are put into action ... time of testing wisdom by bringing it into physical being and helping it to grow ... We can then sense those patterns and respond by stabilizing those patterns that we find desirable, by destabilizing those we do not want, and by seeding the space so that patterns we want are more likely to emerge

> The West is the direction of autumn, sunset, middle age, fire and the intellectual world. In the West connections begin to harden into customs and rules, and central and networked forces intermingle for good and ill. Here the experts know the answers, because they keep the knowledge and wisdom that has arisen and stabilized ... the middle years are those of power ... You have ... made your initial mistakes ... The middle years are the ones of responsibility. There are growing children to raise, there are aging parents to care for, there are younger brothers and sisters to teach and help to find their own paths ... While stable cause and effect relationships exist ... they may be known only by a limited group of people ... Everything in this domain is capable of movement to the known domain. The only issue is whether we can afford the time and resources to move from the knowable to the known; in general, we cannot and instead rely on expert opinion ... Just-in-time (JIT) transfer is movement from the complex to the knowable, selectively. This movement is often called exploitation in the complexity literature, and it involves the selective choice of stable patterns in complex space for ordered representation
    - she'd make diagrams where there's this eye on top that represents the central power structure; "the director" [source](http://www.storycoloredglasses.com/2010/06/confluence.html)
