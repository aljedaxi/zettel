title: confluence framework
---

## Confluence operates on two axes: imposed order and self-organization
## Confluence and Cynefin, where 
- the strength of the central authority recapitulates the strength of the constraints, ie, the extent to which existing techne has already been ossified into rules &c.
- the strength of the meshwork recapitulates the accessibility of techne from your teammates
## she'd make diagrams where there's this eye on top that represents the central power structure; "the director" [source](http://www.storycoloredglasses.com/2010/06/confluence.html)
