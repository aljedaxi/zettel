```
i invite you to wear a suit, to move;
   to sense the wearing of that suit;
             to wear a leather jacket;
             to sharpen your fingernails and blacken your lips;
    how are you speaking?then?
& now---how are you thinking,
                wearing these words?
```
## i *am* a cat; but “Our narrative perspective, Aineko, is *not* a talking cat: it's a vastly superintelligent AI, coolly calculating, that has worked out that human beings are more easily manipulated if they think they're dealing with a furry toy. “ is *not* a cat.
is it the manipulative aspect? the inauthenticity?
