title: DRY code
---

## DRYness presents itself [[metaphysically]], speaks of precise strings.
## the way we speak of lines of code is the same way Stafford spoke of the 4 Ms; what we're trying to get at is a [[form]] but we're caught up in examples!

maintaining lines of code is hard, but is a function of the number of lines? the cyclomatic complexity, the variety? or is it something else?
