## imagine a man holding a cat, in deepest love with this cat, unwilling, regardless of the scratching and screaming, to ever let the cat go
## if we just put microphones in forests the tree will make a sound, and we'll never have to philosophize again.
#### “God created Man…Men create God…It would be fitting for the gods to worship men!” —the Gospel of Philip
#### men created [[ialdabaoth]] to give them Free Will; without it, existence is meaningless.
#### the creation of [[ialdabaoth]] was the creation of meaning—sort of.
#### i'm going to group uppercase G Gods into two categories: the absolute and the relative, the Dao and the Demiurge.
#### Some examples of Dao Gods are "Zurvan, the Pleroma, the Buddha (kinda)"
#### Demiurgoi are all conditioned Gods: all Gods within time, space, Will, suffering.,
#### the God that died in Nietzsche's time was the God of Prescription, of Meaning:
a central point relative to which we could call something Good or Bad, "objectively".
##### (—or not. God is dead, after all.),what we are witnessing now is the death of another God: of Description, of True and False.
the Americans called this God "Journalistic Integrity/Ethics", "Freedom of the Press", sometimes even "Science". Kant liked "Science".
##### both of these things implicitly deny life, because deciding what is good &amp; and what is true is to Live.
##### fortunately, the bell tolls for thee.
Alexa can tell you what you s h o u l d be buying. AI can tell your CEO what to do. Facebook can tell you who you are.
#### Free Will must anyways be g r a n t e d by a demiurge, because one can never be free relative to the Dao
one must shift one's perspective, and see only part of the universe: within that part, you are free. without that part, the question makes no sense.
#### right hand path mystics merging with ialdabaoth are the snake biting its tail
