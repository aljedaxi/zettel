## ((6000d0f3-fbe7-4273-91ff-736f45406e39))
## Good and True are two grounds for all things
## Truth is communicated via [[meaning]], just as [[substance]] is communicated via perception. Truth is deduced from meaning as substance is induced from perception.
## The tautology is the intrinsically, intuitively true. In that sense, it is the intuition.
- And all a priori truths are subsets of this ground.
## To [[know]] a rock *an sich* is a nonstarter. One can only know knowledge, abstractions, models. >>>> EHUMUM Knowledge must be constructed as a trait on a form.
## UNIVERSALS ARE A PROBLEM WHICH MUST BE FIXED, AND THAT MEANS âˆ€
## To say the senses give us correct information is to assume real condition p is translated transparently into condition q.
## We might say that truth is a property of a proposition, just like any other. But, statements as objects, possessing properties, what others might it have? Spookiness, platonism
