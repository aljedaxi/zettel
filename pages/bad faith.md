title: bad faith
---

- Sartre has this conception of the unified individual:

> Though bad faith is described as an attempt to lie to oneself, it does not seem possible for a person to keep the truths they already possess away from themselves

but i think people keep information from themselves all the time. the left hand can know something the right doesn't, even in the average person.
