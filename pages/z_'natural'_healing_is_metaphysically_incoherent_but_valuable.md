title: 'Natural' healing is metaphysically incoherent but valuable
---

## Quotes:
- "Physicians need to be given time to listen to their patients â€“ not necessarily because that will allow them to identify and cure illnesses more easily, but because being invited to tell your story is an essential part of the healing process."
- "Mainstream medicine ... would do well to address the need for metaphysical consolation"
