## Section 1
###
> there is no longer an exterior for the existent if one means by that a superficial covering which hides from sight the true nature of the object
[1]
###
> force ... is not a metaphysical conatus ... which hides behind its effects ... it is the totality of these effects
[1]
###
> the act is everything ... genius ... is neither the work considered in isolation nor the subjective ability to produce it ... [but] the work considered as the totality of the manifestations of the person. 
that is why we can ... reject the dualism of appearance and essence ... the appearance does not hide the essence ... it reveals it ... it is the essence. 
the essence of an existent ... is the manifest law which presides over the succession of its appearances.
But essence ... is ... only the concatenation of appearances ... itself an appearance.
[2]
###
> the reality of the cup is that it is there and that it is not me ... the series of its appearances is bound by a principle which does not depend on my whim.
[3]
### the *principal of the series* is by nature infinite: there are infinite ways in which the principal may manifest itself. [3]
##
> it shows itself as the structure of the appearance, which is at the same time the principle of the series
[3]
##
> the essence finally is radically severed from the individual appearance which manifests it, since on principle it is that which must be able to be manifested by an infinite series of individual manifestation.
[4]
##
> the appearance can not be the thin film of nothingness which separates the being-of-the-subject from absolute-being
## consider the platonic conception, in which the form precedes the hyle into which it is imprinted: where is the being in this formula?
## abschattung is a shading, a shadow
