## RE: work
- Deal rules would be a core set of [[fixed constraints]] that apply to all deals
	- eg, contract terms, design templates, owners, approvers, &c.
	- /TODO the tool should expose its best practices
- the creation of internal alignment is the application of these constraints to attain [[clarity]]
- what is it to create a security [[framework]]?
## any negations is a constraint
