## RE: work
- Deal rules would be a core set of [[fixed constraints]] that apply to all deals
	- eg, contract terms, design templates, owners, approvers, &c.
	- /TODO the tool should expose its best practices

- what is it to create a security [[framework]]?

### [[coffee without]] cream -> tells us more about the system the proposition inhabits than it does the truth grounds of the proposition
