title: it's funny and deeply frustrating that our society believes it's complicated to figure out if someone is autistic, ND, or NT when honest answers to just a few questions could tell you definitively bc every group thinks fundamentals of the other groups' brains don't even exist

## 
> if a colleague at work told you that you were doing a part of your job wrong and should do it another way they think is better - do you think they said it to make you feel or look bad or so they’d look smart? would it make you feel bad or offend you?
### i've heard that this is just normal in germany

> Allistic NDs, especially those who think they’re NT, believe everyone’s brain does that. They have selfish desires, but they analyze them and if it feels too unjustified, they can’t act on it. They hurt people sometimes but not on purpose - they’re trying their best.
### one can concieve of a reading of Nietzsche where christianity (& the superego) is concieved of as an anxiety disorder that everyone in Germanic Europe has
rendering the society at large Allistic ND
#### [If you think everyone has an ego and selfishness they fight to overcome and a rational process that weighs that self-interest with that of others ... you’re ND](https://twitter.com/erikaheidewald/status/1369216156070907904?s=20)

> think back to the workplace criticism. NTs also feel hurt by it and they’re equally sensitive to rejection - but they don’t agonize over whether it was their fault and blame themselves. they see it as clearly the other person’s fault. that person MADE them feel this way.
### this reminds me very much of the whole "Japanese teenagers think that emotions come from outside of them" thing
## like, Camus has the absurd
that conception that beyond the human, there exists the sort of absolute chaos of whatever
but everything we interact with is a processed version of that raw whatever
and it's like, the means by which i process that is fundamentally different from other people
but just everythign about the world; the conceptions we hold to be fundamental
(but of course, we aren't actively holding them; they hold us; they are our fundaments)
those are completely different person to person
the absurd isn't the boundary between us and the noumena, it's like, me and you and everyone else the absurd is between everything, even this me and the me of yesterday
there is no base anywhere
absolute baselessness

> It makes you a terrible ally. It leads to the belief that oppression people tell you is intentional isn’t as serious as they say it is, that it can be fixed with some open dialogue and education. Your empathy for the oppressor will make you fail to adequately defend the oppressed
## NTs be like:
> [To NTs, everything is personal. They don’t hold themselves to the same standard they hold others to bc they feel sure that what they do is justified. When they do something morally questionable they don’t feel bad bc they’re positive everyone is doing that and not admitting it.](https://twitter.com/erikaheidewald/status/1369218755893497860?s=20)
> [NTs don’t want to understand you or play by your rules. They think they already understand you and that no matter what you say, you have to be playing by theirs.](https://twitter.com/erikaheidewald/status/1369225983102836740?s=20)
