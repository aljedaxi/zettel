title: it's funny and deeply frustrating that our society believes it's complicated to figure out if someone is autistic, ND, or NT when honest answers to just a few questions could tell you definitively bc every group thinks fundamentals of the other groups' brains don't even exist

> if a colleague at work told you that you were doing a part of your job wrong and should do it another way they think is better - do you think they said it to make you feel or look bad or so they’d look smart? would it make you feel bad or offend you?
### i've heard that this is just normal in germany

> Allistic NDs, especially those who think they’re NT, believe everyone’s brain does that. They have selfish desires, but they analyze them and if it feels too unjustified, they can’t act on it. They hurt people sometimes but not on purpose - they’re trying their best.
### one can concieve of a reading of Nietzsche where christianity (& the superego) is concieved of as an anxiety disorder that everyone in Germanic Europe has
rendering the society at large Allistic ND

> think back to the workplace criticism. NTs also feel hurt by it and they’re equally sensitive to rejection - but they don’t agonize over whether it was their fault and blame themselves. they see it as clearly the other person’s fault. that person MADE them feel this way.
### this reminds me very much of the whole "Japanese teenagers think that emotions come from outside of them" thing
## like, Camus has the absurd
that conception that beyond the human, there exists the sort of absolute chaos of whatever
but everything we interact with is a processed version of that raw whatever
and it's like, the means by which i process that is fundamentally different from other people
but just everythign about the world; the conceptions we hold to be fundamental
(but of course, we aren't actively holding them; they hold us; they are our fundaments)
those are completely different person to person
the absurd isn't the boundary between us and the noumena, it's like, me and you and everyone else the absurd is between everything, even this me and the me of yesterday
there is no base anywhere
absolute baselessness
