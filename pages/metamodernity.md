## the ironic [[mode]] must be weaponized in service of sincerity
## the rise of the shrek-style antihero represents the beginning of the meta-modern mode
### the transition innocence -> anti-hero -> hero is a recapitulation of the phygenetic transition modernity -> postmodernity -> metamodernity
## a bunch of media has this sort of metamodern oscillation between the anti-hero and the heroic plot structure
## hundreds of otherwise gifted individuals have been crushed by the cynicism of postmodernity

>>imagine a metamodern rhetoric; a swirling around a point, through over simplification and complication: a warm inviting water for toes, and a reminder to not sink into sophistry<<
