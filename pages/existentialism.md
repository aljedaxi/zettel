title: existentialism
---

- Once you make a decision, you're no longer *living*
*Living* is the creation of values
You have to *live with* your old life
I *live with* veganism
  - no, that's wrong, every day when i approach the fridge i make the decision to be vegan. every day when i choose something off a menu i make that decision.
