## RAW NOTES:

- we can understand revelation through art: the means of [[abstraction]] shifts the pattern of shadows & light
- what does this piecement, the [[techne]], reveal?
  - framing, [[parergon]]
  - cupping, the interplay of sweetness, acidity; the ways of brightness
  - walking, & the facilitation of thought; how i came up with the talk ideas on the way to sanctuary
