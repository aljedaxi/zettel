## the test suite must be considered on a feature by feature basis
### relative to the ui, a [[feature]] is a system of affordances and feedbacks that communicate a machine's behavior
### relative to the programmer, a [[feature]] is a [[purposeful]] behaviour in the system.
### the aim of a test suite is to document the key behaviours that must be afforded.
### changes to a software system is [[complex]] without a test suite: experiments (tests) must be run continually to discover the links between the changes made and the preexisting affordances.
the test suite creates [[governing constraints]]; the job of implementing the feature becomes [[clear]].
### we can test anything that has features, traits, eg, contracts;
