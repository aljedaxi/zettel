## ethics (as in $$\eta\theta o\sigma$$) meant---in the prechristian world---character.
### actions are the realization of character.
### in the post christian world, it came to be understood as concerning the soul.
#### the cosmos is not ethical. the goodness of its working was senseless.
#### individual judgement; individual punishment; individual reward.
### every moral call is not to *better our selves through bettering the world*, but rather to *better the world though bettering ourselves*.
#### at the core of this is the separation of humanity from the world

## What is it for something to be desirable?
Why should i bother myself with the potential? What matters is the actual.
Desirability only matters in that it predicts desire. And that prediction is only valuable in that it predicts value: it is the value that has value. 
Who's surprised?

But that wasn't what i'd meant to get at. Rather:
“What is worthy of desire?”
truly the height of prescriptivism.
