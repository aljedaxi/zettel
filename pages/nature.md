## nature (physis) existed (from at least 300BCE) to the Greeks in opposition to the supernatural. [['Natural' healing is metaphysically incoherent but valuable]]
### the carving of the natural from the supernatural recapitulates the carving of the physical (physis) from the non-physical, phenomena from noumena, experts from laypeople. the definition lies in the [[dichotomy]].
#### in the absence of serious education, laypeople are no longer able to [[make sense]] of the physical: the physical becomes [[complicated]]; the spiritual becomes [[clear]]
##### combine this with boomers, the powerful, whose entire life has always been clear,
##### at the outset of illness, one is thrust bureaucratic clarity---a shooting of the cat---an weak gloss over the obvious complication festering beneath (chaos, to the onlooker)
##### illness itself tears the conception of "the body" away from the self; the *senselessness* of physicality forces itself upon the body, rupturing the barrier between "self" and "world"
###### agency (sense) must be clawed back by returning to clarity; "natural" cures [[make sense]] to the layperson
####### snake oil has the extra advantage of extending one's agency over all illness
