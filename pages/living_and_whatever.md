## Pick one change you’ve made (or attempted to make in the past).
 If the change was to do something less (e.g. check your phone less), ask yourself how you could restrict the number of different contexts that might trigger your behavior.
 If the change was to do something more (e.g. read more books), ask yourself how you could expand the contexts that trigger your behavior.
## Pick an activity you wish you did more.
    Pick an activity you feel you do too much.
    Now, ask yourself how you could restrict the second activity to a narrow context. For instance, if you want to cut back on online news, you could restrict yourself to checking once in the morning. If you make this a habit, it won’t feel as obvious to check news in the evening, because they rely on different contexts.
    How could you inject the activity you’d like to do more in the time you’ve taken back?
## measure, from the time you say you'll do deep work, to the time you get distracted, how long each day you work focusedly.
