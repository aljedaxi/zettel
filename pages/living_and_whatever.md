## Pick one change youâ€™ve made (or attempted to make in the past).
 If the change was to do something less (e.g. check your phone less), ask yourself how you could restrict the number of different contexts that might trigger your behavior.
 If the change was to do something more (e.g. read more books), ask yourself how you could expand the contexts that trigger your behavior.
