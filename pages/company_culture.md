## whenever you create a policy, consider the following:
- Messenger  : Ethos
- Incentives : our responses to incentives follow predictable heuristics
- Norms      : we're strongly influenced by others
- Defaults   : we default to defaults
- Salience   : our attention is drawn to novel, interesting, shiny
- Priming    : we aren't [[conscious]] of our influences
- Affect     : emotional responses will fuck everything up
