## Genealogy

Cybernetics was very much a people and a correspondence: a communication. Men "who were authorities, and therefore not scared" [[The falcondale collection]] about their respective fields, gathered in Mexico city to discuss the [[Dao]] between their fields; they understood that to be the most important, the most meaningful stuff (see [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]).

In the context of the university, these people don't talk. they silo along the domain.
