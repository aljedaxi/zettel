## 49th parallel 
Main street
It's a nice building—it's very warm, with orange lights, old raw brick, and dark wooden ceilings and furniture. Bar's wood too. I'd recommend heading round at night. It's got these massive garage doors on the one side, and a motorcycle mural between the two. There's a massive amount of seating, in and outside, with a round cushioned booth, and a few loveseats in the corner; forest of old filament bulbs above them. 49's also down there. 
Espresso:
The crema is pretty poppin, my dude. Very cherry, quite light, very warm, well balanced. It gets stronger throughout the body, with acid beginning to peek through. As one goes down, however, the fruit begins to pierce through everything, crippling that balance. It triggers the “bitterness/mega acid neck muscle spasms”. The bottom is that too the extremes. 
Now, it ain't bad, but it's probably made to be paired with milk/whatever.
Strong 7
