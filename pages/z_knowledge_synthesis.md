title: Knowledge synthesis
---

## “Data model”

In this model, we create and update four basic kinds of entities in the synthesis process: 

Question 
: notes, which express an open research question,

Synthesis 
: notes, which express a single, generalized idea, such as a claim,

Observation 
: notes which express a single, highly contextualized and specific observation that, together with other observation notes, can form the basis of a synthesis note, and

Context snippet 
: notes, which help to ground and contextualize observation notes.
