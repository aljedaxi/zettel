## “Data model”

In this model, we create and update four basic kinds of entities in the synthesis process: 

Question 
: notes, which express an open research question,

Synthesis 
: notes, which express a single, generalized idea, such as a claim,

Observation 
: notes which express a single, highly contextualized and specific observation that, together with other observation notes, can form the basis of a synthesis note, and

Context snippet 
: notes, which help to ground and contextualize observation notes.

## entities with the same logical form are an [[equivalence class]][source](https://oasislab.pubpub.org/pub/54t0y9mk/release/2#zvhrkk11xf)
##
> Synthesis notes can also be composed into more complex structures (such as arguments or theories or models) through relations with other synthesis notes that vary in complexity from simple "relates to", to implication/explanation and support/opposition.
