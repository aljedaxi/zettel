title: allegory of the alethiometer

- Let us say i had an alethiometer. The main issue would be interpreting what it said

I have an Allesschneider :the i ching 
I have infinite alethiometers:
Only i cannot read them
- what is it to [[measure]] [[alethia]]? just as one measures the temperature of the air, one measures the truth of a proposition.
