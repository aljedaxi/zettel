## "Logic transfers Certainty between propositions" 
    why it's important ; stats and maths
    stoic egg : logic, physics, ethics
    deduction is perfect ; induction is subprime
"The proposition says something about a Universe"
    ie, it proposes/represents states of affairs
    King of France Problem? 
"That Universe is the logical system" 
    mathematics & the system of axioms
    logic deals only in truths — the logical universe
    the false as illogical
    When a logical derivation is true
        "it's true when it can't be false"
"If a system is logical it is valid.
 If a system represents states of affairs in our universe, it is sound"
    back to Certainty & truth
    Logic is valuable when it is sound
        value, mathematics
    accuracy? 

"logic is the general form of Abstraction"
## there is the end of the system,
the limit of the system
and the world outside the system
###
## To [[think]] about an argument is to [[think]] the logical form of the argument.
### logic is the study of [[form]]

Be engaged. Those who are motivated by their personal engagement in a situation are more likely to make the effort to counteract their initial judgments.

Believe you can be smarter. Belief and positive thinking can make it true. This will lead you to keep an open mind and ask questions.

Take a step back. Imaginative thinking is enhanced when we walk away from a problem. Distance gives perspective.

Take time to learn your own mental hiccups allows you to apply the time you spend on actually learning. Keep a journal. **Write everything down and then look for patterns, without jumping to conclusions.** Again gaining perspective.
## 'fire'⊃'hot' — both as conditional and as super set
## All logical deductions are of the form 
- p⊃q
- In which p is the assumption and q is the conclusion. They are tautologies by definition.
- The assumptions are the context by which q exists—ie is true.
