## "Logic transfers Certainty between propositions" 
    why it's important ; stats and maths
    stoic egg : logic, physics, ethics
    deduction is perfect ; induction is subprime
"The proposition says something about a Universe"
    ie, it proposes/represents states of affairs
    King of France Problem? 
"That Universe is the logical system" 
    mathematics & the system of axioms
    logic deals only in truths â€” the logical universe
    the false as illogical
    When a logical derivation is true
        "it's true when it can't be false"
"If a system is logical it is valid.
 If a system represents states of affairs in our universe, it is sound"
    back to Certainty & truth
    Logic is valuable when it is sound
        value, mathematics
    accuracy? 

"logic is the general form of Abstraction"
## there is the end of the system,
the limit of the system
and the world outside the system
###
## To think about an argument is to think the logical form of the argument.
### logic is the study of form
