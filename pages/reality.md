## The difference between objective and subjective reality is novel stimulus. 
Physical—ie real things—do not need the dialectical process[1] in order to create them. Hence, they can be truly novel. 
As such, if something is to novel, it must have been created by natural—or, mechanical—processes. 
¹ the dialectical process only affects mental things. There is micro dialectics, which governs the individual, and macro, which is in the societal stage.
