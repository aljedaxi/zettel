You totalize yourself

You impose yourself upon me

You can be perfect from this angle—but where are you thence?

You can have convos like this w thea—but will u?? (No. Give them jeagerbombs)

You can't ignore me fucker, if I'm not u ur me

Ur sichlichkeit is michlichkeit; u r u through me

U can get drunk & close ur eyes, but u can't close ur mind.
U can't close ur drunkenness

We long for control
We long to lose control
We long
