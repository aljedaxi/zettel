## %something about hooka 
%The fundamental media: light, air, direct contact
```
                      The
         air breathes 
                             guava
            .         bubble       gum
            . 
Coal Vapor  .   flesh weighs
      down             upon    the bone.

```
the clouds hang heavy
soaked by the sun's blood and bile
  screaming  ,  puce  ,  violet  .
      the calm of blue ruptured by
       a death rattle of yellow.
```
## Are not only for me 

The clouds paint the sky with a scant urgency,
The stony–bed rivers do warble gladly,
The grasses, they sing in so many a key,
And the stars are not only/simply for me

And the stars shine for more than just me

Und die Sterne sind nicht für nur mich

# Aubade
Enter:  sun,
–––spilt.
so i harken:
"hither,ho;,,run;
    ::::::::::::
::::never dither,
:death's door is spun
in webs,constellating
:what day may become.

Beetle in a 
# box 

        Für Wittgenstein

We each have  our own beetle,
         raw  and      fetal, 
          in  our        box. 
we feel its  form-free features,
             measure  creatures, 
             by its thoughts. 
And though  we fully know it, 
            can we   show it, 
            via          vox? 
So here's  my prediction,
          (my)abdication,
           of    the box.
