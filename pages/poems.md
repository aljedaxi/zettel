the clouds hang heavy
soaked by the sun's blood and bile
  screaming  ,  puce  ,  violet  .
      the calm of blue ruptured by
       a death rattle of yellow.

## Are not only for me 

The clouds paint the sky with a scant urgency,
The stony–bed rivers do warble gladly,
The grasses, they sing in so many a key,
And the stars are not only/simply for me

And the stars shine for more than just me

Und die Sterne sind nicht für nur mich

Beetle in a 
# box 

        Für Wittgenstein

We each have  our own beetle,
         raw  and      fetal, 
          in  our        box. 
we feel its  form-free features,
             measure  creatures, 
             by its thoughts. 
And though  we fully know it, 
            can we   show it, 
            via          vox? 
So here's  my prediction,
          (my)abdication,
           of    the box.

```Oh, 
   how i knew it too good to be true ,
how i knew i could not trust my eyes ,
for the Geist of Bohemia Baudelaire knew
died with that man, and his times.
Oh, 
   how the streets of Paris once glew,   ¹
as they flowered, in spirit and size !

1  glowed, if you will.

# Breathed  
My, how little air slips through
Breathed,unbreathed,between us two
my, how little space we knew!
So much more
         than we needed to breathe.

## O, to be in windswept trees,
a raging, storming mass of leaves,
and i drop within its sea—
convecting through eternity

O, to live 'mongst long lived grass,
'long their tide-shift, iridescent mass,
Whose aleatory works outlast,
Each human piece, which try surpass
## Continental is wide and open and feels a bit Gothic—ie, gothicismus—as opposed to, say, cybergoth ravers. The tables are marble topped, and the feet are cast iron, clawy. The seats are all on the old side. Decorations are sparse; the walls are all pure white, the ground a lovely tan-orange tile. One side is all window, and the 5 o'clock sun casts dramatic shadows through the front parlor. 
The rest of the lighting is supplied by gallery lights, or ye Olde hanging filament bulbs. 
…There's something unnerving about the back. There's something unnerving about the whole place. I feel like i'm in a noir picture, or a doldrums song. And the music doesn't help—its at just the same volume as the drone of the Airconditioning (or something) and generally, I feel disconnected with reality. 
Which, i dunno, had its upsides and its downsides. 
The espresso :
The crema's prime feature is its creaminess—bubbliness. It's served on a white tray, in a white mug, with sparkling water and a dark chocolate. It's gently caramely, gently fruity, gently acid; always gentle. And yet there's something about it. Something nips at the edges of my awareness, something i can't quite place my tongue on. Something feels… watery: there's a superficiality to it; a distance. Like you're tasting it through a commodore 64. Bitterness reactions hit me, but there's little bitterness. My neck is stiff. I feel lightheaded. 
Maybe i'm just having an existential crisis. Or maybe this coffee is a bit strange. 
Don't like the bottom. 

Light 7.
## death came 
all over my chest
in a series of stony-sweet kisses
in a putrefying glaze of golden grimace

such is death in life   light caught in
an uncaught cup        a shattered hope
of a pour, now over      the floor

art was edged; closer, closer, coming,
    til
i stopped sucking(up to it)
i am above(it: this is)my guillotine
      blade in the gut of Good Taste

“there's something about cross
         -dressing.”      they said;
      “, something about cross
              -ing those lines;
      existing in  limbo,      between

      expectation.”
      “instead of a fixed form, you
           become a cloud of un-

I am death
          ly
             intoxicated
  now, in    the grip of
             non-gripance
       it    only makes sense to
             communicate with those
             who i so dearly
                  —so dearly—
  miss.      who i
                   so dearly wish
    to speak with,                to meet again
meet me, carol, meet me

just enough
            for me,    & 
my paperwhite daughters,
   Carol, Edda, heroic verse
   —their many boyfriends,
            bound(friends,)—
by steel set calligraphy, wracked 
by shelves of hard paper, judicable
by a symbol of symboline symbols,
                  judged by the pre-

so we know them not at all.
existence weighs just as heavily
    as time presses down—

Throat, or cut-throat.
                       you make 'The Cut',
        or you get cut, you dig?
        ain't all my girls made it alive.
  gotta keep some kind of qualityControl,
                        you dig?




 quick to read, awful to write,
  you'd expect a greater respect
   for poetry. But my daughters come home, 
    every night, crying of how
     all the boys  just want sex;
     quick exhaustion of memetic drive;
     no regard for romance, no—

Ensō 

 what  gender  am i,
when all my world's 
 the give
 of  a        brush,
and the flow of Ink?

{what,  who,  when}
       is     there
{      to    be  ,
       worth being}, 
 save     the focus
 that  lays the Ink?

## Free Verse 
the violent water's frothing mouth does feed 
the stills and waves    ;   eddying into the
margins, foaming white with rage.  the edges
guide the bubbling lines     :     alēae  in
a box.         The Ravens and i—black as ink—
all do our best to watch.

The violent water's frothing mouth does sing
A siren's reeeeeeeeee;the crows and i listen, 
respond,with free verse,out of key. the dice
turn up   a number   I'm   afraid      i can
not read           —before i can decipher it,
it's changed by a crow's feet.

The violent water's frothing mouth   extends
into the deeps;stretched about four steps of
concrete,rolling with each leap. the bubbles
speak in warbling tongues, which I cannot re-
peat;and yet   the Ravens warble on,   their
truth their wingèd beat.
