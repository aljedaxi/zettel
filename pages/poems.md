## %something about hooka 
%The fundamental media: light, air, direct contact
```
                      The
         air breathes 
                             guava
            .         bubble       gum
            . 
Coal Vapor  .   flesh weighs
      down             upon    the bone.
```
## the clouds hang heavy
soaked by the sun's blood and bile
  screaming  ,  puce  ,  violet  .
      the calm of blue ruptured by
       a death rattle of yellow.
