## %something about hooka 
%The fundamental media: light, air, direct contact
```
                      The
         air breathes 
                             guava
            .         bubble       gum
            . 
Coal Vapor  .   flesh weighs
      down             upon    the bone.

```
the clouds hang heavy
soaked by the sun's blood and bile
  screaming  ,  puce  ,  violet  .
      the calm of blue ruptured by
       a death rattle of yellow.

## Are not only for me 

The clouds paint the sky with a scant urgency,
The stony–bed rivers do warble gladly,
The grasses, they sing in so many a key,
And the stars are not only/simply for me

And the stars shine for more than just me

Und die Sterne sind nicht für nur mich
