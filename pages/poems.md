                      The
         air breathes 
                             guava
            .         bubble       gum
            . 
Coal Vapor  .   flesh weighs
      down             upon    the bone.

the clouds hang heavy
soaked by the sun's blood and bile
  screaming  ,  puce  ,  violet  .
      the calm of blue ruptured by
       a death rattle of yellow.

The clouds paint the sky with a scant urgency,
The stony–bed rivers do warble gladly,
The grasses, they sing in so many a key,
And the stars are not only/simply for me

And the stars shine for more than just me

Und die Sterne sind nicht für nur mich

"…the flux destroys the cowardice of the postmodern, and the naïveté of the modern.

You won't find shelter in this helter skelter."
