  Beetle in a 
  # box 
  
          Für Wittgenstein
  
  We each have  our own beetle,
           raw  and      fetal, 
            in  our        box. 
  we feel its  form-free features,
               measure  creatures, 
               by its thoughts. 
  And though  we fully know it, 
              can we   show it, 
              via          vox? 
  So here's  my prediction,
            (my)abdication,
             of    the box.

  and i drop within its sea—

- Continental is wide and open and feels a bit Gothic—ie, gothicismus—as opposed to, say, cybergoth ravers. The tables are marble topped, and the feet are cast iron, clawy. The seats are all on the old side. Decorations are sparse; the walls are all pure white, the ground a lovely tan-orange tile. One side is all window, and the 5 o'clock sun casts dramatic shadows through the front parlor. 
  The rest of the lighting is supplied by gallery lights, or ye Olde hanging filament bulbs. 
  …There's something unnerving about the back. There's something unnerving about the whole place. I feel like i'm in a noir picture, or a doldrums song. And the music doesn't help—its at just the same volume as the drone of the Airconditioning (or something) and generally, I feel disconnected with reality. 
  Which, i dunno, had its upsides and its downsides. 
  The espresso :
  The crema's prime feature is its creaminess—bubbliness. It's served on a white tray, in a white mug, with sparkling water and a dark chocolate. It's gently caramely, gently fruity, gently acid; always gentle. And yet there's something about it. Something nips at the edges of my awareness, something i can't quite place my tongue on. Something feels… watery: there's a superficiality to it; a distance. Like you're tasting it through a commodore 64. Bitterness reactions hit me, but there's little bitterness. My neck is stiff. I feel lightheaded. 
  Maybe i'm just having an existential crisis. Or maybe this coffee is a bit strange. 
  Don't like the bottom.

  # Letters 
  ¡MUST BE PRESENTED WRITTEN
   BY HAND,
  ,IN CURSIVE,
   WITH LONG ESSES          !
  
  it sometimes astounds me—truly—that
  there was a time when letters were written
  Letters!

  —but a temporal God.Within, 
  and without,

  its skelton has been found! 
  and *here* it is, drawn
  out in pretty little loops, letters 
  playing at reincarnation but losing
  
  time.
               perhaps, 
  it's not the player, 
  but the game itself, not the loser, 
  but a thing to be lost:
  less romantic than typewriting,
  greater than typesetting,
  as letters (re)incarnate ever on,
  
  like Socrates and Plato;
  like courier new terminals in OSX.

  # Life 
  Illusions exist to be pierced and puzzled, 
          And such is the meaning of life. 
  A choice without options is moot & a muzzle, 
        And such is the meaning of strife. 
  
  What good is existence in stasis? In flux, 
      There's signal—and noise—on the line. 
  If life is the story, then death is the crux, 
   Without water, what's there in the wine?

  So sang the sight
  of the blue eyed beast.
- i would die to keep you
  warm in my embrace
  till we both turn to ash
  in the sun's icy case

	  ________padded,    sullen,     white;
	      the ground, the cloud, the breeze,
	                            drag
	           sound      less        ly     inward
	    and the skin   drags     the spirit
	    screaming      down     to the fire.

	    spearhead on skin, screech-
	   skrying the sands ; through the hands
	           through the ear, seep-ing
	                   slippppppppppping, thr
	              ougn     sand.
