## Magic matcha mug cake 
Magic Mug Cake
The mean lady who famously said, “Let them eat cake,” was obviously not talking about green matcha mug cake. This one is easy, fun and colorful. Oh, it tastes great too.
Use a large mug that is microwave safe. Place the following ingredients into the mug:
One-quarter teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon food-grade matcha powder, 1 tablespoon (or more) white sugar, one-half tablespoon vegetable oil, 3 tablespoons non-fat milk, and 4 tablespoons of flour.
Use a whisk or spoon to mix the batter until its color and consistency is uniform. Place it in the microwave for one minute, and then let it cool for 2 or 3 minutes. Eat. Repeat.
