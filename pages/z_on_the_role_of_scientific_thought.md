title: On the role of scientific thought
---

##
> "scientific" ... in ... "scientific thought" more refers to a *way* of thinking than to *what* ... the "quo modo" rather than to the "quod"
## 
> to my taste is characteristic for all intelligent thinking ... that one is willing to study in depth an aspect of one's subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, ... knowing that ... is ... only ... one of the aspects ... a program must be correct ... that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day ... But nothing is gained—on the contrary!—by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called "the [[separation of concerns]]" ... "focusing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously
## 
> A scientific discipline emerges with the —usually rather slow!— discovery of which aspects can be meaningfully "studied in isolation for the sake of their own consistency" ... the discovery of useful and helpful concepts ... Scientific thought comprises in addition the conscious search for the useful and helpful concepts
## 
> the efficiency of our thinking processes is what I am talking about
[[cognitive load]]

> From a logical point of view, this objection is nonsense: if your specifications are contradictory, life is very easy, for then you know that no program will satisfy them, so, make "no program"; if your specifications are ambiguous, the greater the ambiguity, the easier the specifications are to satisfy (if the specifications are absolutely ambiguous, every program will satisfy them!).
## 
>  the sole purpose of the specifications to act as the interface between the system's users and the system's builders ... "making a thing satisfying our needs" as a single responsibility is split into two parts "stating the properties of a thing, by virtue of which it would satisfy our needs" and "making a thing guaranteed to have the stated properties"

> "ALGOL 60 was a very inefficient language", while what he really meant was that with the equipment available to him, he and his people had not been able to implement ALGOL 60 efficiently
## 
> any odd collection of scraps of knowledge and an arbitrary bunch of abilities ... do not constitute a scientific discipline ...  The internal requirement is one of coherence: the knowledge must support the abilities and the abilities must enable us to improve the knowledge ... The external requirement is ... the more self-supporting such an intellectual subuniverse, the less detailed the knowledge that its practitioners need about other areas of human endeavour, the greater its viability. In the terminology of the computing scientist I should perhaps call our scientific disciplines "the natural intellectual modules of our culture". (When the layman asks the computing scientist, what is meant by "Modularization", a reference to the way in which the knowledge in the world has been arranged, is probably the best concise answer.)
