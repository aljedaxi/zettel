title: On the role of scientific thought

##
> "scientific" ... in ... "scientific thought" more refers to a *way* of thinking than to *what* ... the "quo modo" rather than to the "quod"

> to my taste is characteristic for all intelligent thinking ... that one is willing to study in depth an aspect of one's subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, ... knowing that ... is ... only ... one of the aspects ... a program must be correct ... that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day, so to speak. In another mood we may ask ourselves whether, and if so: why, the program is desirable. But nothing is gained —on the contrary!— by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called "the separation of concerns", which, even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by "focussing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously
