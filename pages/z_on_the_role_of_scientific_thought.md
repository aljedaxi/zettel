title: On the role of scientific thought
---

##
> "scientific" ... in ... "scientific thought" more refers to a *way* of thinking than to *what* ... the "quo modo" rather than to the "quod"
## 
> to my taste is characteristic for all intelligent thinking ... that one is willing to study in depth an aspect of one's subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, ... knowing that ... is ... only ... one of the aspects ... a program must be correct ... that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day ... But nothing is gained—on the contrary!—by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called "the [[separation of concerns]]" ... "focusing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously
## 
> A scientific discipline emerges with the —usually rather slow!— discovery of which aspects can be meaningfully "studied in isolation for the sake of their own consistency" ... the discovery of useful and helpful concepts ... Scientific thought comprises in addition the conscious search for the useful and helpful concepts
## 
> the efficiency of our thinking processes is what I am talking about
[[cognitive load]]

> From a logical point of view, this objection is nonsense: if your specifications are contradictory, life is very easy, for then you know that no program will satisfy them, so, make "no program"; if your specifications are ambiguous, the greater the ambiguity, the easier the specifications are to satisfy (if the specifications are absolutely ambiguous, every program will satisfy them!).
## 
>  the sole purpose of the specifications to act as the interface between the system's users and the system's builders. The task of "making a thing satisfying our needs" as a single responsibility is split into two parts "stating the properties of a thing, by virtue of which it would satisfy our needs" and "making a thing guaranteed to have the stated properties". Business data processing systems are sufficiently complicated to require such a separation of concerns and the suggestion that in that part of the computing world "scientific thought is a non-applicable luxury" puts the cart before the horse: the mess they are in has been caused by too much unscientific thought
