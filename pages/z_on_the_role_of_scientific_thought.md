title: On the role of scientific thought

##
> "scientific" ... in ... "scientific thought" more refers to a *way* of thinking than to *what* ... the "quo modo" rather than to the "quod"
## 
> to my taste is characteristic for all intelligent thinking ... that one is willing to study in depth an aspect of one's subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, ... knowing that ... is ... only ... one of the aspects ... a program must be correct ... that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day ... But nothing is gained—on the contrary!—by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called "the separation of concerns" ... "focusing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously
## 
> A scientific discipline emerges with the —usually rather slow!— discovery of which aspects can be meaningfully "studied in isolation for the sake of their own consistency"
