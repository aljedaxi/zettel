title: org chart
---

## an org chart is a [[picture]] of an organization.
## form is function; the subset of relations the org chart 
chooses to picture dictate its use to the reader. (
metadata (parergons) colour the nascent gestalt. 
function emerges from form, and action emerges from function.
) the traditional org chart is useful for 
finding managers to complain and suck up to, 
but practically useless otherwise. 

a company directory, with enough columns, is a poor, 
but functional org chart; its gestalt, while occluded 
to the human observer, is perfectly clear to a machine. 
from here, we're free to construct a form for any function, 
bounded only by the measurements in our directory (
& whatever data we can link to it, eg, jira, CODEOWNERS
).
