title: alienation
---

## TODO despair (as it’s explored in Kierkegaard) is a KIND of alienation. Alienation is talked about mainly in Hegel, whose project was then taken up by Heidegger and Marx. In Hegel, alienation is described at a disjunction between being in the world and being in oneself. On page 74, Kierkegaard critiques Hegel as being too lofty in the creation of his systems, without giving due diligence to how alienation affects us materially and indivdually.

This is Marx’s project. Migotti said that, in Kierkegaard’s terms, Marx diagnoses the sickness in society through the proletariat/bourgeoisie dialectic. For instance, the petty bourgeoisie that has status but still doesn’t have the security and comfort of the actual bourgeoisie is in despair of ignorance of their own despair. I don’t quite know how we get to Heidegger from this though, I think it has something to do with how Heidegger asks “alienation from what? alienation of who?” which I guess sparks questions of being
## usages of alienation:

Hegel
: dysphoria between being in the world and being in oneself

Marx
: alienation from the means of production; alienation from your own labour, alienation from yourself, 

Heidegger
: we are alienated from our own humanity, our own nature. Das Mann is alienated; Das Mann doesn't think for himself, doesn't make his own choices.
