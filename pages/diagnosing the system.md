- Diagrammatic conventions
  
  Square
  : all managerial activity need to run
  
  Circle
  : the relevant operations that produce the viable system
  
  Amoeboid Shape
  : the environment
  
  Red Arrows
  : necessary interactions between the basic entities
- Principals:
  
  One
  : Varieties, diffusing through an institutional system, tend to equate
  
  Two
  : Channel capacity must be $$\geq$$ the originating subsystem's variety *as* the subsystem creates the variety
  
  Three
  : The variety of a transducer must be $$\geq$$ than the channel capacity
- Tasks:
	-
	  > In which viable system are you embedded? How many recursive systems can you list before you reach some kind of 'totality'? ... Please make some kind of diagram, so that ... a record of your investigations is begun
		- Eg, (Total Industry (Heavy Industry (Iron & Steel (Cold Working (Wire (Fine Wire))))))
		  You are Fine Wire
	-
	  > Think of a Manufacturing company ... list the organizations of the next lower recursion ... the embedded subsidiaries or departments that between them **produce the company** ... they are essentially profit centres ... they can in principle be ... sold as going concerns (and replaced by bought-in products or services) ... Next make a list of company system ... that are **not** embedded viable systems
	-
	  > Choose and clearly define the System-in-focus ... survey the sets of recursions of viable systems that constitute its organizational 'ecology', both vertically and horizontally ... Give the System-in-focus a well-chosen name ... specify, with a name, the viable system in which your system is embedded ... exactly specify, with names, the viable systems that your system-in-focus embeds
	-
	  > retrieve your list of the embedded subsidiaries or departments ... this list adds up to system one ... make a large diagram---one for each of them---to look like figure 7 [{environment, ops, management, and the attenuators & amplifiers between them}] ... write in all the mechanisms that pertain to variety engineering
	-
	  > System One is bound into the parent ... by its Articles of Association, and by ... the Companies' Act ... but the parent may ... specify other constraints ... these range from delimiting technologies to specifying the modus operandi ... list them for each of your embedded system one elements
	-
	  > list your mechanisms for striking the resource bargain for each subsidiary
	-
	  > examine precisely how accountability is exercised, and especially what attenuators ... are used
	-
	  > the transmission of plans, programmes, and procedures to the operational circle should be regarded as an act of *regulation* ... regulation ... attenuates operational variety ... the regulatory center ... is the focus of homeostasis between management and operations ... make a list of regulatory actions that mediate between system one managements and their operations
	-
	  > Make lists of your own instances relating to the two-way channels between management/operations
-
  > this book ... should *guide* any manager ... in the light of [[cybernetics]] ... with requiring of [them] any prior knowledge ... of this ... interdisciplinary subject
-
  > The Handbook reduces the electronics to diagrams. This book reduces cybernetics to diagrams.
-
  > we cannot tackle everything at once ... [eg] the problems of *measurement* and *filtration* that are dealt with in ... *The Brain of the Firm* and *The Heart of the Enterprise*.
-
  > Finally, the recursive embodiments of **[[language]]** as a [[viable system]] took us from philosophy through linguistics to anthropology, and back again
-
  > [[cybernetics]] is the science of effective organization.
-
  > it was later mathematically proved that such a system must necessarily contain a representation ... of whatever is being regulated
-
  > Solvency ... is a prerequisite of business ... Profitability, too ... but they do not ... constitute the goals of the enterprise. Rather are they the *constraints* under which it operates ... to treat all this as the essence of viability is to mistake the epiphenomena of the system ... for the system itself ... viability in complex organisms is not ... primarily concerned with the energy ... that propels them, but with the dynamic structure that determines the **adaptive connectivity** of their parts.

	  > This FOREWORD is over --- so: FORWARD ...
	-
	  > please think about this responsibility for resources provided in terms (... not of emotional dependency)
-
  > the way you are likely to get results ... is to arrange the organizational structure differently ... the problems that people were worrying about will then be not so much solved as dissolved. This means that you will not get any credit.
-
  > existence is never independent of other existences, even though the individual has a separate **identity**
-
  > the viable system is necessarily a **producer** of the organization ... list the organizations of the next lower recursion --- that is, the embedded subsidiaries or departments that between them PRODUCE THE COMPANY ... the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys ... are all engaged in *producing* the organism ... in the firm ... the profit centres produce the company ... it is continuous and regenerative self-production that underwrites IDENTITY
	-
	  > if the product is 'sold' only internally ... the unit is not a viable system --- especially insofar as it has no exposure to market forces
-
  > its ecology --- environmental interaction with an 'outside'
-
  > what the biologist calls the [[internal [[environment]]]]
-
  > the **set** of these embedments will be known as [[SYSTEM ONE]]
	-
	  > Management in [[System One]] is charged with conducting its operations according to a [[Resource Bargain]] struck with Senior management
-
  > The [[Resource Bargain]] is the 'deal' by which some degree of autonomy is agreed between senior management and its junior counterparts ... [it] declares: out of all the activities that [[System One]] might undertake, these will be tackled ... and not those ... and the resources negotiated to these ends will be provided

  > regulation ... amplifies managerial variety
-
  > thus ... [system two] is the focus of homeostasis between management and operations
-
  > The ... channels carrying information between the managerial unit, the operation, and the environment must each have a higher [channel capacity] ... than the originating subsystem has to generate [variety] ... the capacity of an actual channel depends ... on the rate of data transmission
	-
	  > the variety of the transducer must be at least equivalent to the variety of the channel
-
  > data are transmitted, not variety ... variety is amplified or attenuated by the instructions that the data formulate

	  > If we look on [[technology]] as ... a [[variety]] generator, and not simply as a producer of artifacts, then our regulatory capability is enhanced
- Our Resource Bargain is backlog grooming: you must accomplish these things
