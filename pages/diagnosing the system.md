- Diagrammatic conventions
  
  Square
  : all managerial activity need to run
  
  Circle
  : the relevant operations that produce the viable system
  
  Amoeboid Shape
  : the environment
  
  Red Arrows
  : necessary interactions between the basic entities
- Principals:
  
  One
  : Varieties, diffusing through an institutional system, tend to equate
  
  Two
  : [[Channel capacity]] must be $$\geq$$ the originating subsystem's variety *as* the subsystem creates the variety
  
  Three
  : The variety of a transducer must be $$\geq$$ than the channel capacity
  
  Four
  : The operation of the above must be cyclically maintained through time without hiatus or lags
  
  Axioms of Management:
  
  First
  : The sum of horizontal variety disposed by all the operational elements EQUALS the sum of vertical variety disposed on the six components of corporate cohesion
- Tasks:
	-
	  > In which viable system are you embedded? How many recursive systems can you list before you reach some kind of 'totality'? ... Please make some kind of diagram, so that ... a record of your investigations is begun
		- Eg, (Total Industry (Heavy Industry (Iron & Steel (Cold Working (Wire (Fine Wire))))))
		  You are Fine Wire
	-
	  > Think of a Manufacturing company ... list the organizations of the next lower recursion ... the embedded subsidiaries or departments that between them **produce the company** ... they are essentially profit centres ... they can in principle be ... sold as going concerns (and replaced by bought-in products or services) ... Next make a list of company system ... that are **not** embedded viable systems
	-
	  > Choose and clearly define the System-in-focus ... survey the sets of recursions of viable systems that constitute its organizational 'ecology', both vertically and horizontally ... Give the System-in-focus a well-chosen name ... specify, with a name, the viable system in which your system is embedded ... exactly specify, with names, the viable systems that your system-in-focus embeds
	-
	  > retrieve your list of the embedded subsidiaries or departments ... this list adds up to system one ... make a large diagram---one for each of them---to look like figure 7 [{environment, ops, management, and the attenuators & amplifiers between them}] ... write in all the mechanisms that pertain to variety engineering
	-
	  > System One is bound into the parent ... by its Articles of Association, and by ... the Companies' Act ... but the parent may ... specify other constraints ... these range from delimiting technologies to specifying the modus operandi ... list them for each of your embedded system one elements
	-
	  > list your mechanisms for striking the resource bargain for each subsidiary
	-
	  > examine precisely how accountability is exercised, and especially what attenuators ... are used
	-
	  > the transmission of plans, programmes, and procedures to the operational circle should be regarded as an act of *regulation* ... regulation ... attenuates operational variety ... the regulatory center ... is the focus of homeostasis between management and operations ... make a list of regulatory actions that mediate between system one managements and their operations
	-
	  > Make lists of your own instances relating to the two-way channels between management/operations ... **channel** capacity is the discussion point ... what **measures** do you have --- or need?
	-
	  > Make ... analytic vignettes of the transducers that populate your own system one [the transducers E <=> O, O <=> M] ... and try to make an enormous diagram ... annotating for the **three principles**
	-
	  > draw ... only the operational circles of the elements you have already isolated and examined seperately, and think about the connexions between them ... the squiggly red lines [between the circles in a VSM diagram]
	-
	  > Make a copy of ... Figure 19 [system one, with $n$ triangles to the right of the squares, and $n$ triangles to the right of senior management. each triangle is connected by to a grid of red lines, of size $n\cdot n$; the bottom triangle has a square called $C$ on the rightmost line, in the center of its bottommost section; $B$ on the second to bottom, second to right section, &c. ] ... Now find at least three Systems Two, entering these functions in the red boxes A, B and C.
	-
	  > Consider your own system-in-focus. does it have something you would call 
	  > - a salary policy? - a car policy? 
	  > Are these so-called 'policies' (which are expected to be **low** variety under this name, or its synonym 'guidelines')
	  > - actually **high** variety RULES promulgated on the central command axis?  - System Two activities, preserving some local autonomy?
	  > WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE THE EMPHASIS?
	  > - HOW? - And how would you achieve this?
	-
	  > Bring the sketches ... up to date, in a form that ... ensure[s] that the five vertical linkages [Corporate Intervention, the Resource Bargain, operational linkages, environmental intersections, and System Two] are sufficiently well represented ... Does ... Senior management have REQUISITE VARIETY to absorb the variety proliferated by the horizontal elements of system one?
	-
	  > Make a list of the System Three components ... that means
	  > Who are those who partake in resource bargaining, the allocation of resources, the accountability loop;
	  > what supportive management does each have to administer the A, B, C ... activities of System Two;
	-
	  > Refer to Figure 21, on which the six vertical variety absorbers [Corporate Intervention, the Resource Bargain, operational linkages, environmental intersections, System Two, System Three*] are shown. Determine for your system in focus how the first axiom appears to be met
	  > As System three sees it;
	  > As System one sees it
	  (System one will likely see it as everything coming down by dictat, while system three will see it as being all healthy)
