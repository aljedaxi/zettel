##
> technology is getting better because of Moore's law
##
> letting the computer figure out how to do it
okay but somebody is always writing the bit underneath it
## 
> never being exposed to the ideas of the past; alternative models of what programming can be
## there's great variety within the bounds of a sort of functional-OOP hybrid, but very little on the outskirts of it
## so now we must have our heiddeggers, digging through the dustbin of computing history to find the coffees with rosewaters
## 
> it was early enough that nobody knew what programming was
