> I ... imagine them as truly heroic ... people who are able to exist in a space where others don’t see who you know yourself to be, but you just don’t care. Your sense of yourself is so strong you don’t need to change your body to get other people to see you in a certain way; you just know that other people are wrong and that you’re right and that’s okay
###
> ... And so, maybe it’s just true that for some people like me, we really do care enough to transition, while other people don’t care ... or it’s not their central concern ... Or, maybe there’s something else that this entire discursive framing is missing ... about the relationship between gender presentation and reception ...
### 
> I think that transition is often a practical decision and I think what puzzles me in contemporary discourse is that it does away with that phenomenology of what it means to be in the world with other people by replacing it with a notion of the sovereign self: ***I decide who I am, I know who I am inside and then I tell people. I say I’m nonbinary, or trans, and I go by they/them***
## 
> In my life I had associated it with the most unbearable dysphoria, the most unbearable gap between how I was seeing myself and how other people were seeing me, especially once I had taken on the pronouns he/him but was trying to transition without testosterone
## 
> this is what it means to identify **with** this as opposed to that, this is what you do
## 
> When I was a boy and a faggot in my early twenties it was fairly legible in my small community in Durham, North Carolina, because everybody knew me, so it felt phenomenologically real
## 
> the early 2000s, it was the age of Tumblr and other online spaces where all kinds of queer people and **people who thought they might be trans** were endlessly reflecting on their genders
## 
> All the critiques of nonbinary’s mainstream uptake as overly aesthetic, as a category largely consumed around white androgynous, masculine images are great, but then look also at trans femmes and see how hard it is to give that positive account of the self and desire, too
## 
> involves proclaiming a real desire to be a woman—and who the fuck in this world is allowed to desire to be a woman?
## 
> that was what I imagined myself transitioning into—the faggot, not the man. And then I was very disappointed to become a faggot and to see that gay male culture was not that interested in faggots
## 
> There’s so much more cultural space for mascs, including nonbinary, and there’s so much more history (for butches and non-binary mascs). There’s so little of this for nonbinary femmes and to me that means that femmes really occupy a different gender from nonbinary mascs that is not covered by the umbrella term nonbinary.
## 
> What I’ve realized is that I believe that the matter of gender is practical and relational. It’s not about who you are inside, it’s more about how you would feel most comfortable in the world. It’s not Who are you? but How do you want to live?
