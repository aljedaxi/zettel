## individual actions are political only insofar as that person acts on behalf, or on, a political entity, or their action has political implications
### all actions have political implications
### an individual cannot share a [[thought]] with another individual without translating it into language, baking it into a cultural context.
## bourgeois democracy is anti-fragile:
energy roused by discontent with the system is funneled back into the system via party politics
