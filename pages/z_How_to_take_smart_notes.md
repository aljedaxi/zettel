## Teachers mistake the following of [[best practices]] for expertise[1p65]. environmental variables are systematically ignored until the situation can be reduced to something [[clear]]. what does this say about Kantianism? "an exclusive use of analytical rationality tends to impede further improvement [1p63]".

## '"no, no!" Feynmann protested, "They aren't a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. **I actually did the work on the paper**.[1p91]
## the act of learning is the act of drawing connections. the propositions of the text are made [[meaningful]] through their integration with what the learner already knows.
### to have forgotten is to not be able to recall; 
to be able to recall is to've learned;
learning involves systems of recollection
### a Zettelkasten is a picture of a recollective system
a model of "that which is remembered, and how"
## "too much [[order]] can impede learning" [p99] -> ie, too harshly governing constraints. Sense is made through the movement of propositions into [[order]], the construction of clarity.

what is it to think?

what is the form of the idea?

what is the academic mode? a questioning / questing towards \?truth? interesting questions? if so---or if anything like it is so---such a mode must be spread throughout society. every question ever asked may and should be treated with dignity.

the "good reader" is the reader who understands that a text is a system of purposeful [[Lichtung]]en and occlusions. the "poor reader" sees only that which is lit.
 -> the "good reader" is in "dialog" (their reading is dialectical), while the "poor reader" is listening.
 -> to "see only that which is lit" is to subconsciously accept the author's system 
 (of biases?)

 an idea is a picture of an aesthetic.
    -> ie --- an idea??
	-> a note is a picture of an idea?
	-> a note is an idea?
	
"and one is the myth of the [tabula rasa] itself" [1p10]

notes that describe subjects are something like research questions

the software needs to have ways to visualize the connections between notes ; ways of viewing clusters
	-> see what is there, what is missing, what questions arise
	-> the answer to the question is a next note
	-> "do not brainstorm for a topic" [1p29]
## the process

- always have something on hand 2 take notes
- whenever you read something that makes you think, note that down with the bibliographic data
- forEach idea you've noted, explain it well enough that anyone can read it. full sentences, references.
- add that note to the slipbox. link it to related notes, your index, and notes that describe subjects.
