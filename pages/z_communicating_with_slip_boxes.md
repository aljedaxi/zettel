title: Communicating with Slip Boxes

> It is impossible to think without writing; at least it is impossible in any sophisticated or networked (anschlußfähig) fashion

> Information is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: “this or something else.” 
> For communication, we do not have to presuppose that both parties use the same comparative schema. **The effect of surprise even increases when this is not the case and when we believe that a message means something (or is useful) against the background of other possibilities**.

> Put differently, the variety in communicating systems increases when it may happen that the two partners successfully communicate in the face of different comparative goals. (This means that it is useful for the other partner.) 
> This requires the addition of randomness (Zufall) into the system—randomness in the sense that the agreement of the different comparative schemata is not been fixed, or that the information which is transmitted by communication is correct, but rather that this happens (or does not happen) “at the occasion” of communication.

> It proves to be similar to our own memory in that it does not have a thoroughly constructed order of its entirety, not hierarchy, and most certainly no linear structure like a book.
-
> Every note is only an element which receives its quality only from the network of links and back-links within the system.

> If, however, we seek communication with the slip box, we must seek internal possibilities for linkings which result in the unexpected (i.e. information). We could try to generalize the experiences of Paris, Florence, New York under general concepts like “art” or “exhibitions,” or “crowding” (inter-actionistic), or “mass,” or “freedom” or “education,” in order to see how the slip box reacts. Usually it is more fruitful to look for formulations of problems that relate heterogeneous things with each other.
- 
> In any case, communication becomes more fruitful when we succeed to activate the internal network of links at the occasion of writing notes or making queries. ... The slip box provides combinatorial possibilities which were never planned ... the internal horizons of selection and comparisons are not identical with schema of searching for them.
