# How to take smart notes: 1542866502

systems can only act upon an interface. your interfaces must be designed to expose the aspects of the system that [should change?]

what is it to think?

what is the form of the idea?

an idea is a picture of an aesthetic. 
	-> a note is a picture of an idea?
	-> a note is an idea?
	
"and one is the myth of the [tabula rasa] itself" [1p10]

notes that describe subjects are something like research questions

the software needs to have ways to visualize the connections between notes ; ways of viewing clusters
	-> see what is there, what is missing, what questions arise
	-> the answer to the question is a next note
	-> "do not brainstorm for a topic" [1p29]
## the process

- always have something on hand 2 take notes
- whenever you read something that makes you think, note that down with the bibliographic data
- forEach idea you've noted, explain it well enough that anyone can read it. full sentences, references.
- add that note to the slipbox. link it to related notes, your index, and notes that describe subjects.
