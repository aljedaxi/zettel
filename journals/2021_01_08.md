## the prestige form of communication for zoomers is text smile
## the brain is all too eager to return to homeostasis, regardless of the lack of ease or comfort that exists in that state
## you have to be more willing to write things down. when something enters the mind you have to capture it or it will slip away

### if we understand ontogeny to recapitulate phylogeny, philosophy—as manifested in the socratic project—is the linguistic organism self reflecting upon its linguistic faculties
#### this project was, of course, the Dialectic
#### the hegelian dialectic may be understood as the recapitulation of the socratic dialectic: in both cases, the speaker is attempting to understand what they're saying
#### the necessity—the mere existence, rather—furthers my theory that words don't have meaning until meaning is ascribed to them post hoc
#### that is too say, words are boxes without beetles, until beetles are assigned to said boxes by the Dialectic

       couldn't keep us close
                                         by, bye bye
                     O, blow on by,

salty, softly, summer-spray,
you belong by the sea
what a frosty folly, now
to trap you here,
with me.

### always blow candles out with \n a breathy "good night"
### who are these Twitter celebrities i follow?
not quite an anon, not quite a name.

neither real nor fake. news
this is the world we wear.
### humans are always parts of the systems they interact with.
a system is a system of interactions between nodes.

### the Christian-LogicFreak conflation of order with negentropy sincerely pisses me off
### our current pace of progression is based on the assumption we can—but don't have to—replace the old tech in our systems
### what's true is true forever,
why don't you know everything
now?
### i am the creator of the phenomenal world
### i don't think i believe in "the senses" anymore. The body has more sensory apparati than we can…sense? We feel the weight of our stomach, the hints of tastes;the way our heads and bodies tilt;heat, pain, pressure;acceleration;the texture of the ground;how we look when we dance…
### i tend to imagine signals in the brain are just signals; and the process of interpreting those signals has everything to do with the wiring in that part of the brain, and nothing to do with the sense organ that bore it

### looking away shall be my only negation…some day i wish to be only a Yes-sayer.

### it must be understood as the *aboslute value* of the derivative of variety over time. a sudden---purposeful---drop in variety is agility.
